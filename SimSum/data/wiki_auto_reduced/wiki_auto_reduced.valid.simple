There are many kinds of icosahedra, with some being more symmetrical than others. <s> The best known is the Platonic, convex regular icosahedron. <s> There are two objects, one convex and one concave, that can both be called regular icosahedra. <s> Each has 30 edges and 20 equilateral triangle faces with five meeting at each of its twelve vertices. <s> Both have icosahedral symmetry. <s> The term "regular icosahedron" generally refers to the convex variety, while the nonconvex form is called a "great icosahedron". <s> The convex regular icosahedron is usually referred to simply as the "regular icosahedron", one of the five regular Platonic solids, and is represented by its SchlaÌˆfli symbol {3, 5}, containing 20 triangular faces, with 5 faces meeting around each vertex. <s> Its dual polyhedron is the regular dodecahedron {5, 3} having three regular pentagonal faces around each vertex. <s> The great icosahedron is one of the four regular star Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra. <s> Its SchlaÌˆfli symbol is {3, }. <s> Like the convex form, it also has 20 equilateral triangle faces, but its vertex figure is a pentagram rather than a pentagon, leading to geometrically intersecting faces. <s> The intersections of the triangles do not represent new edges. <s> Its dual polyhedron is the great stellated dodecahedron (, 3), having three regular star pentagonal faces around each vertex. <s> Stellation is the process of extending the faces or edges of a polyhedron until they meet to form a new polyhedron. <s> It is done symmetrically so that the resulting figure retains the overall symmetry of the parent figure. <s> In their book "The Fifty-Nine Icosahedra", Coxeter et al. enumerated 58 such stellations of the regular icosahedron. <s> Of these, many have a single face in each of the 20 face planes and so are also icosahedra. <s> The great icosahedron is among them. <s> Other stellations have more than one face in each plane or form compounds of simpler polyhedra. <s> These are not strictly icosahedra, although they are often referred to as such.

They are also known as admins, sysops, and janitors. <s> Administrator are appointed following a successful request for adminship. <s> As of 2019, there are administrators on the Simple English Wikipedia. <s> Administrators have special rights that other editors do not have. <s> On Wikipedia, becoming an admin is often referred to as being "given or taking up the mop", a term which has also been used elsewhere. <s> In 2006,there were about 1,000 administrators on the English Wikipedia. <s> In July 2012, it was reported that Wikipedia was "running out of administrators". <s> This was because in 2006-2007 an average of 40-50 new administrators were appointed. <s> In the first six months of 2012 only 9 new administrators were appointed. <s> But the co-founder of Wikipedia, Jimmy Wales, did not believe that this was a crisis. <s> He also did not believe Wikipedia was running out of admins. <s> Wales said earlier that being an admin is "not a big dealâ€. <s> He also said that "It's merely a technical matter that the powers given to sysops are not given out to everyone.â€ <s> He said this in a message he sent to the English Wikipedia mailing list on February 11, 2003. <s> In his book "Wikipedia â€“ The Missing Manual", John Broughton states that while many people think of administrators on Wikipedia as judges, that is not the purpose of the role. <s> Instead, he says, admins usually "delete pages" and "protect pages involved in edit wars". <s> The first Wikipedia administrators were appointed by Jimmy Wales himself in October 2001. <s> Any registered editor may nominate themselves, or may request another editor to do so. <s> The process has been said to be "akin to putting someone through the Supreme Court" by Andrew Lih, a scientist and professor who is himself an administrator on the English Wikipedia. <s> Lih also said, "It's pretty much a hazing ritual at this point", in contrast to how the process worked early in Wikipedia's history, when all one had to do to become an admin was "prove you weren't a bozo" Editors can become candidates only after "extensive work on the wiki". <s> Any editor can vote in an RfA. <s> The decision if a consensus has been reached can only be made by a bureaucrat. <s> A bureaucrat is a Wikipedia editor who is also appointed by the community through a "request" process which is much stricter for them than for administrators. <s> This RFA process was started after RfAs attracted a lot of attention. <s> Before the middle of 2005, RfAs did not attract a lot of attention. <s> But then RfAs started attracting groups of editors who all supported one another. <s> When an admin blocks a user they must do so according to Wikipedia's policies. <s> One of the policies is that a reason must be given for the block. <s> The reason for the block is permanently logged by the software. <s> A scientific paper by researchers from Virginia Tech and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute found that after editors are promoted to administrator status, they often focus more on articles about controversial topics than they did before. <s> The researchers also proposed an alternative method for choosing administrators, in which more weight is given to the votes of experienced editors. <s> Another paper, presented at the 2008 Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, analyzed data from all 1,551 requests for adminship from January 2006 to October 2007 to find out which (if any) of the criteria recommended in Wikipedia's "Guide to requests for adminship" page were the best predictors of whether the user in question would actually become an admin. <s> In December 2013, a similar study was published by researchers from the Polish-Japanese Institute of Information Technology in Warsaw which aimed to model the results of requests for adminship on the Polish Wikipedia using a model derived from Wikipedia's edit history. <s> They found that they could "classify the votes in the RfA procedures using this model with an accuracy level that should be sufficient to recommend candidates."

County Cavan (in Gaelic, ) is a county in Ireland. <s> It is part of the Border Region as it is on the border with Northern Ireland. <s> It is part of the province of Ulster. <s> It is named after the town of Cavan. <s> Cavan borders six other counties: Leitrim to the west, Fermanagh and Monaghan to the north, Meath to the south-east, Longford to the south-west and Westmeath to the south. <s> The county has a lot of countryside with many lakes and small hills called drumlins. <s> Not many people live in the north-western area of the county as there are many mountains. <s> The highest point of the county is in the Breifne mountains, mount Cuilcagh at 665 m. <s> Many rivers in Ireland start in County Cavan. <s> The Shannon Pot is the source of the River Shannon, the longest river in Ireland at 386 km. <s> The River Erne is a major river which rises from Beaghy Lough south of Stradone in Cavan and flows for 120 km to Lough Erne. <s> Cavan is known as 'The Lakeland County' and it is said it has 365 lakes, one for every day of the year. <s> At 18.8 km2, Lough Sheelin is the county's largest lake situated in the south of the county. <s> A large area of lakes in the north and west of Cavan are marked as Specially Protected Areas (SPA), example of this being Lough Oughter. <s> Other important wildlife protected lakes such as Lough Gowna and Lough Ramor are in the south and east of the county. <s> The county contains forests such as Bellamont Forest near Cootehill, Killykeen Forest Park at Lough Oughter (a Coillte state forest), DuÌn na RiÌ Forest Park and the Burren Forest. <s> In medieval times, the area of Cavan was part of East BreÌifne after its ruling Gaelic family. <s> This in was a division of the 11th century Kingdom of BreÌifne. <s> For this reason the county is also sometimes known as the Breffni County. <s> The natural landscape of drumlin hills and loughs made a good defence against invaders. <s> Historically, Cavan was part of the western province of Connacht, but was transferred to Ulster in 1584 when BreÌifne was shired and became the county of Cavan. <s> In the south, the Lough Sheelin area was part of Leinster until the late 14th century. <s> Parts of Cavan were under Norman influence from the twelfth century. <s> The remains of several buildings from the time can still be seen at Castlerahan and Clogh Oughter castle. <s> There are also some remains of early abbeys in the county, like at Drumlane and Trinity Island. <s> The Plantation of Ulster from 1610 saw the settlement and origins of several new towns within the county like Bailieborough, Cootehill, Killeshandra and Virginia. <s> Existing towns such as Cavan and Belturbet became over time more important as trading centres. <s> Wars aimed at trying to unsettle the Plantation only led to further plantations of English and Scottish settlers into the county and the beginnings of a thriving flax and linen industry. <s> Agriculture is the largest industry in the county, especially dairy milk processing as well as pig and beef farming. <s> Much of Cavan's land is clay soils, which are rich in minerals, but heavy and poorly drained, making pasture farming the dominant farming system in the county. <s> There is a total farmed area of 144269 ha in the county, and there are approximately 219,568 cattle in Cavan. <s> Cavan has expanded in other industries, mainly quarrying, energy production and manufacturing facilities. <s> Peat cutting exists in the northwest of the county, in the Cuilcagh range.

916 America is a minor planet that is orbiting the Sun in the main belt between Mars and Jupiter. <s> It was discovered on 7 August 1915 by the Soviet astronomer Grigory Nikolaevich Neujmin at Simeis, Ukraine. <s> It was originally called 916I, but was renamed "916 America" on 24 February 1923 after the Council of Astronomers at Pulkovo Observatory decided to pay tribute to "the friendly relations of the astronomical observatories and astronomers". <s> Another possible reason for the name was as a mark of thankfulness for the help given during the famine in Crimea by the American Relief Administration under President Herbert Hoover. <s> In 1986, believing that the asteroid was of S-type and that it had a diameter of 15 km, the length of 916 America's day was thought to be 38 hours. <s> Observations by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite have since shown that it has a diameter of 33.2Â±1.3 km, with an absolute magnitude of 11.20 and an albedo (the extent to which it reflects light) of 0.053Â±0.004.

S/2004 S 6 is the designation of a dusty object seen orbiting Saturn very close to the F ring. <s> It is not clear whether it is only a clump of dust, or if there is a solid small moon at its core. <s> It was first seen by scientists in pictures taken by the Cassini-Huygens probe on October 28, 2004, and announced on 8 November that year. <s> It appears to be the best tracked object in this area with at least five possible sightings in the period till late 2005. <s> In comparison, two objects in the F ring's area (S/2004 S 3 and S/2004 S 4) that were first seen months earlier have not been found again with any confidence. <s> Nevertheless, it continues to be unclear whether there is a solid core to S/2004 S 6 or whether it is just a dust clump that will disappear in years or months. <s> Notably, an imaging sequence covering an entire orbital period at 4 km resolution taken on 15 November, 2004 (soon after S/2004 S 6's discovery) failed to find the object, while it has been seen again later. <s> The lighting conditions in S/2004 S 6's part of the orbit were different during these two sightings, however, with the discovery being made when the area was strongly backlit by the sun. <s> A suggested resolution of the absence in November is that S/2004 S 6's visibility is primarily due to a diffuse cloud of fine dust that is much brighter in forward scattered light (the conditions of the discovery image), and that the solid core (if any) is small. <s> S/2004 S 6 has been seen both inside and outside the main F ring, and its orbit must cross the ring. <s> Careful calculations show that the object periodically plows through the ring material, coming within 1.5 km of the densest core e.g. on 9 April, 2005. <s> It has been suggested that a spiral structure in the thinnest material around the F ring may have been a result of this. <s> The dusty halo seen in pictures is big, being around 2000 km in lengthwise extent. <s> The solid object, if any, would be no bigger than 3âˆ’5 km in diameter based on brightness.

The Ancient Egyptian royal titles were a standard way of naming the pharaohs, the kings of Ancient Egypt. <s> The full set of titles, the titulary, using the five names, became the standard and were still in use as late as the Roman Empire. <s> G5-O33 The Horus name is the oldest form of the pharaoh's name. <s> Many of the oldest-known Egyptian pharaohs were known only by this title. <s> The Horus name was usually written inside a serekh. <s> This was a symbol of a palace facÌ§ade. <s> The name of the pharaoh was written in hieroglyphs inside the serekh. <s> Usually there would be an image of the falcon God Horus on top or beside it. <s> One Egyptian ruler, the 2nd dynasty Seth-Peribsen, used an image of the god Seth instead of Horus. <s> Perhaps this was showing there had been some kind of religious division within the country. <s> He was succeeded by Khasekhemwy, who placed the symbols of both Set and Horus above his name. <s> Later kings always had the image of Horus beside their name. <s> By the time of the New Kingdom the Horus name was often written without the enclosing serekh. <s> The name is first definitively used by the First Dynasty pharaoh Semerkhet. <s> It became an independent title by the Twelfth Dynasty. <s> The Nebty name was not usually framed by a cartouche or serekh. <s> It always begins with the hieroglyphs of a vulture and cobra resting upon two baskets, the dual noun "nebty". <s> G8 This was also known as the "Golden Horus Name". <s> The pharaoh's name featured the image of a Horus falcon perched above or beside the hieroglyph for gold. <s> The meaning of this title has been disputed. <s> It could show the triumph of Horus over his uncle Seth, the symbol for gold meaning that Horus was "superior to his foes". <s> Gold also was linked with ideas of eternity, so name may show the pharaoh's eternal Horus name. <s> Like the Nebty name, this name was not framed by a cartouche or serekh. <s> M23:t-L2:t The pharaoh's throne name, the first of the two names written inside a cartouche, with the title "nsw-bity" ("nesu-bity, nesw-bit, nswt-bjtj"). <s> This is often translated as "King of Upper and of Lower Egypt", as the sedge and bee were symbols for Upper and Lower Egypt. <s> The epithet "neb tawy", "Lord of the Two Lands", meaning the valley and delta regions of Egypt was also often used. <s> - This was the name given to the pharaoh at birth. <s> The name itself was preceded by the title "Son of Ra". <s> This was written with the hieroglyph of a duck ("za"), a homonym for the word meaning "son" ("za"), next to an image of the sun, a hieroglyph god Ra. <s> It was first introduced to the set of royal titles in the Fourth Dynasty and emphasizes the king's role as a representative of the solar god Ra. <s> When the pharaoh was woman, the preceding title was interpreted as "daughter". <s> Modern historians usually use this name for the ancient kings of Egypt, adding ordinals (e.g. "II", "III") for different individuals with the same name.

A botanical name is a formal scientific name which follows the "International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants" (ICN). <s> If it concerns a plant cultigen, the additional cultivar term must follow the "International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants". <s> The code of nomenclature covers "all organisms traditionally treated as plants, whether fossil or non-fossil, e.g. blue-green algae (Cyanobacteria); fungi, including chytrids, oomycetes, and slime moulds; photosynthetic protists and taxonomically related non-photosynthetic groups". <s> The purpose of a formal name is to have a single name which is accepted and used worldwide for a particular plant or plant group. <s> For example, the botanical name "Bellis perennis" was given to a plant species which is native to most of the countries of Europe and the Middle East, where it has various names in many languages. <s> Later it has been introduced worldwide, bringing it into contact with more languages. <s> Some English names for this plant species are: daisy, English daisy, lawndaisy. <s> The cultivar "Bellis perennis" 'Aucubifolia' is a golden-variegated horticultural selection of this species. <s> A name in three parts, i.e., an infraspecific name (a name for a taxon below the rank of species), needs a "connecting term" to indicate rank. <s> In the "Calystegia" example above, this is "subsp." (for subspecies). <s> In botany there are many ranks below that of species (in zoology there is only one such rank, subspecies, so that this "connecting term" is unnecessary there). <s> A name of a "subdivision of a genus" also needs a connecting term (in the "Acacia" example above, this is "subg.", <s> The connecting term is not part of the name itself. <s> For botanical nomenclature, the "ICBN" prescribes a two-part name or binary name for any taxon below the rank of genus down to, and including the rank of species. <s> Taxa below the rank of species get a three part name. <s> A binary name consists of the name of a genus and an epithet.

The Kow Swamp archaeological site is on the eastern side of Kow Swamp in northern Victoria. <s> A number of Pleistocene burials have been found in a sand dune, known as a lunette. <s> Archaeologist Alan Thorne dug up the skeletons of more than 22 people between 1968 and 1972. <s> Kow Swamp is named for an Aboriginal word, "Ghow", from the Yorta Yorta language. <s> It means white gypsum soil which is found in the area. <s> Kow Swamp is now a lake used to store irrigation water. <s> It is 15 kilometres in circumference and about 3 metres deep. <s> It was once a low lying swamp which only filled when the Murray River was in flood or running at high levels. <s> Early European settlers described an Aboriginal ceremonial site on the north side of the swamp. <s> In 1925 part of a skull was found on the west side of the swamp during digging works. <s> The editor of the local newspaper "Cohuna Farmers Weekly" notified authorities and the importance of the discovery was realised. <s> In the 1960s, Alan Thorne also found an ancient bone in the collection at the Museum of Victoria, and traced the find spot to Kow Swamp. <s> Archaeological excavations took place between 1968 and 1972 by Thorne for the Australian National University in Canberra. <s> Further remains were found around the swamp by a local person, Gordon Spark. <s> By 1972 the remains of at least forty individuals had been excavated and studied. <s> These discoveries helped prove the wide range of Aboriginal genetic history. <s> They have been used to show that there were different waves of immigrants to Australia before European discovery. <s> Radiocarbon dating has shown that most of the burials took place between 13,000 and 10,000 years ago. <s> The youngest burial 6500 was about 6,500 years old. <s> Optically stimulated luminesence (OSL) dating in 2003 showed the burials were between 22,000 and 19,000 years old. <s> However, these dates have been questioned due to the difficulty of making sure the dated sand is the same age as the actual burials. <s> Thorne believed that it showed "the survival of "Homo erectus" features in Australia until as recently as 10,000 years ago". <s> However, Donald Brothwell disagreed and said size and shape of the skulls at Kow Swamp had been caused by artificial cranial deformation. <s> They are also different to Pleistocene remains found at Lake Mungo and Keilor. <s> These differences have been used to suggest that different people came to Australia at different times in the past. <s> However, more recent studies do not support this theory. <s> Aboriginal community groups have asked for the human remains from Kow Swamp be returned from Australian and overseas museum collections. <s> The Kow Swamp skeletons were returned to the area and reburied. <s> Casts of some of the Kow Swamp skulls are held by the Archaeology and Human Sciences department at the Australian National University. <s> Some casts are also at London Natural History Museum and other institutions.

An amicus curiae (literally, friend of the court; plural, amici curiae) is someone who is not a party to a case and offers information that affects the case but who has not been asked by any of the parties to assist a court. <s> The decision on whether to admit the information lies at the discretion of the court. <s> The phrase "amicus curiae" is legal Latin. <s> The "amicus curiae" practice was found in Roman law. <s> Later, it was introduced in international law, in particular, concerning human rights. <s> Today, it is used by the European Court of Human Rights. <s> It is also used in the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, the Court of Justice of the European Union and the Special Tribunal for Lebanon. <s> The situation most often noted in the press is when an advocacy group files a brief in a case before an appellate court to which it is not a litigant. <s> Appellate cases are normally limited to the factual record and arguments coming from the lower court case under appeal. <s> Usually attorneys focus on the facts and arguments most favorable to their clients. <s> Where a case may have broader implications, "amicus curiae" briefs are a way to introduce those concerns, so that the possibly broad legal effects of court decisions will not depend solely on the parties directly involved in the case. <s> In prominent cases, "amici curiae" are generally organizations with sizable legal budgets. <s> In the United States, for example, non-profit legal advocacy organizations, such as the American Civil Liberties Union, the Landmark Legal Foundation, the Pacific Legal Foundation, and others, frequently submit such briefs to advocate for or against a particular legal change or interpretation. <s> If a decision could affect an entire industry, companies other than the litigants may wish to have their concerns heard. <s> In the United States, federal courts often hear cases involving the constitutionality of state laws. <s> Hence states may file briefs as "amici curiae" when their laws are likely to be affected, as in the Supreme Court case "McDonald v. Chicago," when thirty-two states under the aegis of Texas (and California independently) filed such briefs. <s> "Amici curiae" who do not file briefs often present an academic perspective on the case. <s> Newspaper editorials, blogs, and other opinion pieces arguably have the capability to influence Supreme Court decisions as "de facto amici curiae". <s> They are not, however, technically considered "amicus curiae," as they do not submit materials to the Court, do not need to ask for leave, and have no guarantee that they will be read. <s> The Supreme Court of the United States has special rules for "amicus curiae" briefs sought to be filed in cases pending before it. <s> Supreme Court Rule 37 states, in part, such a brief should cover "relevant matter" not dealt with by the parties which "may be of considerable help". <s> The cover of an "amicus" brief must identify which party the brief is supporting, or if the brief supports only affirmance or reversal. <s> The Court also requires that, "inter alia", all non-governmental amici identify those providing a monetary contribution to the preparation or submission of the brief. <s> Briefs must be prepared in booklet format, and 40 copies must be served with the Court. <s> In the United States Supreme Court, unless the "amicus" brief is being filed by the federal government (or one of its officers or agents) or a U.S. state, permission of the court (by means of motion for leave) or mutual consent of the parties is generally required. <s> Allowing an "amicus curiae" to present oral argument is considered "extraordinary". <s> The role of "amicus curiae" briefs in the World Trade Organization (WTO) dispute settlement system is controversial. <s> The controversy arises due to the governmental nature of WTO disputes. <s> As only WTO members have access to the system, any non-members such as non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are excluded and have no right to be heard. <s> Thus the only way for them to contribute to a WTO decision is through "amicus curiae" briefs.

The name VaisÌravanÌ£a comes from the Sanskrit visÌravanÌ£a which means "Great Fame". <s> VaisÌravanÌ£a is also known as Kubera in Sanskrit or Kuvera in PaÌ„li. <s> The character of VaisÌravanÌ£a is set up on the Hindu god Kubera, but although the Buddhist and Hindu deities share some characteristics, both of them have different functions and myths. <s> He is often shown with a yellow face. <s> He carries an umbrella as a sign of his power. <s> He is also sometimes shown with a mongoose, often shown spitting out jewels. <s> The mongoose is the enemy of the snake, which is a symbol of greed or hatred; the spitting out of jewels shows generosity. <s> In the PaÌ„li writings of the TheravaÌ„da Buddhist tradition, VaisÌravanÌ£a is called VessavanÌ£a. <s> VessavanÌ£a is one of the Four Great Kings, each one of which rules over a direction. <s> VessavanÌ£a's direction is the northern quarter of the world. <s> As with all the Buddhist deities, VessavanÌ£a is properly the name of a person who has the god inside him rather than a permanent individual. <s> Each VessavanÌ£a is a human, and when he dies, he will be replaced by a new VessavanÌ£a. <s> Like other beings of the CaÌ„tummahaÌ„raÌ„jika world, his lifespan is 90,000 years, but other sources say nine million years. <s> When the Buddha was born, VessavanÌ£a became his follower. <s> He often brought the Buddha and his followers messages from the gods and other humans, and protected them. <s> In Japan, Bishamonten (æ¯˜æ²™é–€å¤©), or just Bishamon (æ¯˜æ²™é–€) is thought of as a god of war or warriors who wears armor, and a punisher of people who do evil things, a view that is very strange when compared with the more peaceful Buddhist king described above. <s> Bishamon is shown holding a spear in one hand and a small pagoda in the other hand. <s> The Pagoda symbolises the divine treasure house, which holds things that he guards and gives away. <s> In Japanese folklore, he is one of the Japanese Seven Lucky Gods. <s> He is also known as the King of the North. <s> As guardian of the north, he is often shown on temple wall paintings outside the main door. <s> He is also a god of wealth. <s> VaisÌravanÌ£a is sometimes shown carrying a citron, the fruit of the "jambhara" tree. <s> The fruit helps pick him out from depictions of Kuvera.

Tropical Storm Beryl was the third tropical storm of the 2006 Atlantic hurricane season. <s> Developing from a tropical disturbance on July 18, it tracked generally northward, and strengthened to attain peak winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) under generally favorable conditions. <s> After turning to the northeast, Beryl weakened over cooler waters. <s> On July 21 it struck the island of Nantucket, and shortly thereafter it became extratropical. <s> The extratropical remnants continued northeastward through Nova Scotia, and on July 22 it merged with an approaching cold front. <s> Beryl produced rough seas along the northeast United States coastline. <s> In Massachusetts, its impact was limited to light rainfall and gusty winds, with no reported damage. <s> Beryl later produced moderate rainfall and gusty winds across Atlantic Canada, resulting in some localized power outages though little damage. <s> No deaths were reported. <s> A cold front moved off the East Coast of the United States on July 16 and stalled off the coast of North Carolina. <s> It slowly decayed into a surface low pressure trough, and developed into two disturbances; one was centered 290 miles (490 km) south-southeast of Cape Cod and another was located 200 miles (320 km) south of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. <s> The first low quickly organized into an unnamed tropical storm, and the other area stayed broad and disorganized. <s> However, by July 18, the system became much better organized with improved banding features, and the area developed into Tropical Depression Two while located 220 miles (355 km) south-southeast of Cape Hatteras. <s> The depression moved slowly to the north-northwest through a break in the subtropical ridge, and as convective banding features became more visible the system strengthened into Tropical Storm Beryl. <s> Throughout much of its duration, the storm tracked through an environment with light vertical wind shear and well-established upper-level outflow. <s> Shortly after becoming a tropical storm, the low-level circulation of Beryl became exposed with limited deep convection, though deep convection re-developed the following morning. <s> Outflow continued to improve, and with warm sea surface temperatures Beryl slowly strengthened further to reach peak winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) early on July 20 while located about 120 miles (190 km) east of Nags Head, North Carolina. <s> Beryl maintained peak winds for about 18 hours as it paralleled the Mid-Atlantic and New Jersey coasts, during which an eye-like feature developed in the center of the convection. <s> Late on July 20, it began a slow weakening trend after passing over cooler waters. <s> Steering winds ahead of an approaching mid-level trough caused Beryl to speed up northeastward, and early on July 21 the center of the storm crossed the island of Nantucket. <s> The convection diminished as it moved through progressively colder waters, and shortly after 1200 UTC on July 21 Beryl became an extratropical cyclone a short distance east of Cape Cod. <s> Hours later, it made landfall in southwestern Nova Scotia, and on July 22 the extratropical remnants of Beryl merged with an approaching cold front over Newfoundland. <s> Forecasters originally predicted Beryl to brush the Carolinas; as such, a tropical storm watch was issued for the eastern coast of North Carolina from Cape Lookout northward to Currituck Beach Lighthouse. <s> When a more northeastward track became apparent, a tropical storm watch was issued about 33 hours before moving ashore from Woods Hole to Plymouth, Massachusetts, including Cape Cod, Nantucket, and Martha's Vineyard. <s> About 22 hours before landfall, the National Hurricane Center replaced the watch with a tropical storm warning for the same area, and also issued a tropical storm watch from Woods Hole, Massachusetts westward to New Haven, Connecticut and for the eastern portion of Long Island from east of Fire Island to Port Jefferson. <s> Expecting for the storm, the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency was activated as a trial run for the hurricane season. <s> Local Red Cross chapters were opened, as well, with two volunteer teams placed on standby to assist. <s> Across southeastern Massachusetts, police departments maintained extra staff in preparation for any potential problems from the storm. <s> Many fishermen secured their boats, while some business owners boarded up windows to prevent storm damage. <s> Several days prior to the passage of Beryl through Atlantic Canada, the Canadian Hurricane Centre issued gale warnings for the coastal waters off of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. <s> In anticipation of heavy rainfall, the agency also issued heavy rainfall warnings for western Nova Scotia, including Halifax. <s> The storm caused high waves along the East Coast of the United States, with 19 foot seas (5.97 m) in the open ocean. <s> Waves along the southern coast of Nantucket reached 10 feet in height as the storm approached the island, resulting in four people being rescued by lifeguards from rip currents. <s> High surf was also reported along the southern coast of Massachusetts and Rhode Island. <s> Beryl also produced a storm surge of 0.9 feet on Nantucket. <s> Winds across southeastern Massachusetts were fairly light, with no sustained tropical storm force winds and wind gusts peaking at 44 mph; unofficially gusts reached 51 mph. <s> Beryl dropped moderate precipitation just offshore, though the maximum precipitation total in the United States was only 0.97 inches (24.6 mm) on Nantucket. <s> Rainfall along southeastern Massachusetts reached 0.33 inches at Chatham. <s> The only reported damage were some downed telephone poles and fallen tree branches. <s> Overall impact was minor; there were no reported power outages, deaths, injuries, or maritime emergencies in association with the storm. <s> The remnants of Beryl dropped moderate precipitation in Atlantic Canada, officially peaking at 2.8 inches (71 mm) in Scotts Bay, Nova Scotia with an unofficially higher total of 3.5 inches (88 mm); in some locations 1 inch of rain fell in an hour. <s> Additionally, a station in Fredericton, New Brunswick reported 1.77 inches (45 mm) in 2 hours. <s> The rainfall caused some flooding, with some overflown streams flooding some streets. <s> Moderate winds were reported along its path, which peaked at 60 mph (96 km/h) in southern Nova Scotia. <s> The winds downed some tree limbs and led to some power outages. <s> Overall damage was minor.

They were once widespread, but now tarsiers live only on islands in south-east Asia. <s> Fossils are found in Asia, Europe, and North America, and some disputed fossils from Africa. <s> The fossil record shows that their teeth have not changed much, except in size, in the past 45 million years. <s> They also have the longest continuous fossil record of any primate. <s> They have large eyes. <s> Each is about 16 mm wide.They are very sensitive to touch, and weigh as much as their entire brain. <s> Unlike many nocturnal animals, tarsiers lack a light-reflecting area (tapetum lucidum) of the eye. <s> They also have a fovea, which is also not usual in nocturnal animals. <s> The tarsier's brain is different from other primates in one respect. <s> The sequence of cell layers in the lateral geniculate nucleus getting information from both eyes is different from the set-up in lemurs, lorises, and monkeys. <s> "This apparent difference distinguishes tarsiers from all other primates, and reinforces the view that they arose in an early, independent line of primate evolution". <s> Tarsiers are the only primates which are wholly carnivorous. <s> They mainly eat insects, but some are also known to eat birds and snakes. <s> Pregnancy takes about six months, which is a long time for such a small animal. <s> Tarsiers give birth to single offspring. <s> Tarsiers have incredibly good hearing.
