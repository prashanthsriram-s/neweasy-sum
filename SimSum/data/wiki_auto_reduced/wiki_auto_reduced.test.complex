Miranda is a novel written by Antoni Lange in 1924. <s> It was the last great work of Lange before he died , and his most famous book today. <s> It is said that "Miranda" is an "occultic fiction" and a "romance ranked to a philosophical treaty". <s> The novel is also known as "novelty writing" which conciliates dystopia and utopia. <s> It is a matter of opinion to classify the novel to modernism or interwar period. <s> The title of the novel refers to the person of Miranda from Shakespeare's play called "The Tempest". <s> "Miranda" is also full of allusions to many classics such as: "Men Like Gods" by Herbert George Wells, "The City of the Sun" by Tommaso Campanella, "Lenore" by Edgar Allan Poe, "Genezis z Ducha" by Juliusz SÅ‚owacki, poems by Cyprian Kamil Norwid, writings of Friedrich Nietzsche (criticism of concept of the UÌˆbermensch), Arthur Schopenhauer, Plato and Sanskrit epics of ancient India. <s> The novel tells about ideal civilisation of powerful mages which have invited paranormal skills like telepathy, levitation and mediumism. <s> The Brahmins value anarchy, freedom, peace, free love and anti-work. <s> Their country is organized by Ministry of Love, Ministry of Power and Ministry of Wisdom, and they use a strange substance classified as Nivridium in order to their self-perfect idea. <s> The main plot is the history of love of Polish emigrant Jan PodobÅ‚oczny (Lange's own "porte-parole") to the materialization of an ideal woman named Damayanti. <s> A tragic end of their romance comes from clash between physical and spiritual sides of human existence. <s> In the last chapter of the novel, Damayanti sacrifices her body in order to let her spirit fly to higher stage of consciousness. <s> Miranda is a Scottish spiritual medium, who lives in Warsaw. <s> She can contact the soul of Damayanti and materialize the mysterious person of Lenore, who meets Jan PodobÅ‚oczny when he is close his death. <s> In the moment when Damayanti dies, Miranda disappears. <s> The novel was translated into English (in 1968), French, Spanish and Italian.
Arm wrestling is a sport involving two participants. <s> Each places one arm on a surface with their elbows bent and touching the surface, and they grip each other's hand. <s> The goal is to pin the other's arm onto the surface, the winner's arm over the loser's arm. <s> In the early years different names were interchangeably used to describe the same sport: "skanderbeg", "arm turning", "arm twisting", "arm wrestling", "indian arm wrestling", "twisting wrists", "wrist turning", "wrist wrestling". <s> Organized armwrestling tournaments started being held in the 1950s. <s> Various factors can play a part in one's success in arm wrestling. <s> Technique and overall arm strength are the two greatest contributing factors to winning an arm wrestling match. <s> Other factors such as the length of an arm wrestler's arm, his/her muscle and arm mass/density, hand grip size, wrist endurance and flexibility, reaction time, as well as countless other traits, can add to the advantages of one arm wrestler over another . <s> It is sometimes used to prove who is stronger between two or more people. <s> In "competitive arm wrestling", as sanctioned by the United States Armwrestling Federation (USAF), arm wrestling is performed with both competitors standing up with their arms placed on a "tournament arm wrestling table" . <s> Arm wrestling tournaments are also divided into weight classes as well as left and right-handed divisions. <s> Furthermore, strict rules such as fouls given to penalties (such as the competitor's elbow leaving a matted area where the elbow is to remain at all times, or a false start), and trying to escape a possible arm pin by breaking the grip with the opponent may result in a loss at the table . <s> Paraphrasing USAF rules, arm wrestlers must straighten their wrists without a time lapse of one minute during competition. <s> The World Armwrestling Federation (WAF) is the universally recognized global governing body of professional arm wrestling and comprises 80 member countries. <s> Arm wrestling puts enormous torque/torsion stress on the upper arm's humerus bone to a degree seen in few other physical activities. <s> Most people's bones are not accustomed to being significantly stressed in this direction, and severe injuries can occur. <s> The arm typically fails because of a diagonal break at or below the midpoint between the shoulder and the elbow; this is known as the 'break arm' position. <s> The most common injury is the humeral shaft fracture.

Pericles ( ; "PerikleÌ„s", ] in Classical Attic; c. 495 â€“ 429 BC) was a prominent and influential Greek statesman, orator and general of Athens during its golden age â€“ specifically the time between the Persian and Peloponnesian wars. <s> He was descended, through his mother, from the powerful and historically influential Alcmaeonid family. <s> Pericles had such a profound influence on Athenian society that Thucydides, a contemporary historian, acclaimed him as "the first citizen of Athens". <s> Pericles turned the Delian League into an Athenian empire, and led his countrymen during the first two years of the Peloponnesian War. <s> The period during which he led Athens, roughly from 461 to 429 BC, is sometimes known as the "Age of Pericles", though the period thus denoted can include times as early as the Persian Wars, or as late as the next century. <s> Pericles promoted the arts and literature; it is principally through his efforts that Athens acquired the reputation of being the educational and cultural center of the ancient Greek world. <s> He started an ambitious project that generated most of the surviving structures on the Acropolis (including the Parthenon). <s> This project beautified and protected the city, exhibited its glory, and gave work to the people. <s> Pericles also fostered Athenian democracy to such an extent that critics call him a populist. <s> He, along with several members of his family, succumbed to the Plague of Athens in 429 BC, which weakened the city-state during a protracted conflict with Sparta. <s> Pericles, following Athenian custom, was first married to one of his closest relatives, with whom he had two sons, Paralus and Xanthippus, but around 445 BC, Pericles divorced his wife. <s> He offered her to another husband, with the agreement of her male relatives. <s> The name of his first wife is not known; the only information about her is that she was the wife of Hipponicus, before being married to Pericles, and the mother of Callias from this first marriage.

The Turin King List, also known as the Turin Royal Canon, is an ancient Egyptian hieratic papyrus thought to date from the reign of Pharaoh Ramesses II, now in the Museo Egizio (Egyptian Museum) in Turin. <s> The papyrus is the most extensive list available of kings compiled by the ancient Egyptians, and is the basis for most chronology before the reign of Ramesses II. <s> The papyrus is believed to date from the reign of Ramesses II, during the middle of the New Kingdom, or the 19th Dynasty. <s> The beginning and ending of the list are now lost; there is no introduction, and the list does not continue after the 19th Dynasty. <s> The composition may thus have occurred at any subsequent time, from the reign of Ramesses II to as late as the 20th Dynasty. <s> The papyrus lists the names of rulers, the lengths of reigns in years, with months and days for some kings. <s> In some cases they are grouped together by family, which corresponds approximately to the dynasties of Manethoâ€™s book. <s> The list includes the names of ephemeral rulers or those ruling small territories that may be unmentioned in other sources. <s> The list also is believed to contain kings from the 15th Dynasty, the Hyksos who ruled Lower Egypt and the River Nile delta. <s> The Hyksos rulers do not have cartouches (enclosing borders which indicate the name of a king), and a hieroglyphic sign is added to indicate that they were foreigners, although typically on King Lists foreign rulers are not listed. <s> The papyrus was originally a tax roll, but on its back is written a list of rulers of Egypt â€“ including mythical kings such as gods, demi-gods, and spirits, as well as human kings. <s> That the back of an older papyrus was used may indicate that the list was not of great formal importance to the writer, although the primary function of the list is thought to have been as an administrative aid. <s> As such, the papyrus is less likely to be biased against certain rulers and is believed to include all the kings of Egypt known to its writers up to the 19th or 20th Dynasty. <s> The papyrus was found by the Italian traveler Bernardino Drovetti in 1820 at Luxor (Thebes), Egypt and was acquired in 1824 by the Egyptian Museum in Turin, Italy and was designated Papyrus Number 1874. <s> When the box in which it had been transported to Italy was unpacked, the list had disintegrated into small fragments. <s> Jean-Francois Champollion, examining it, could recognize only some of the larger fragments containing royal names, and produced a drawing of what he could decipher. <s> A reconstruction of the list was created to better understand it and to aid in research. <s> The Saxon researcher Gustav Seyffarth (1796â€“1885) re-examined the fragments, some only one square centimeter in size, and made a more complete reconstruction of the papyrus based only on the papyrus fibers, as he could not yet determine the meaning of the hieratic characters. <s> Subsequent work on the fragments was done by the Munich Egyptologist Jens Peter Lauth, which largely confirmed the Seyffarth reconstruction. <s> In 1997, prominent Egyptologist Kim Ryholt published a new and better interpretation of the list in his book, "The Political Situation in Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period c. 1800â€“1550 B.C." After another study of the papyrus, an updated version from Ryholt is expected. <s> Egyptologist Donald Redford has also studied the papyrus and has noted that although many of the list's names correspond to monuments and other documents, there are some discrepancies and not all of the names correspond, questioning the absolute reliability of the document for pre-Ramesses II chronology. <s> Despite attempts at reconstruction, approximately 50% of the papyrus remains missing. <s> This papyrus as presently constituted is 1.7 m long and 0.41 m wide, broken into over 160 fragments. <s> In 2009, previously unpublished fragments were discovered in the storage room of the Egyptian Museum of Turin, in good condition. <s> A new edition of the papyrus is expected. <s> The name Hudjefa, found twice in the papyrus, is now known to have been used by the royal scribes of the Ramesside era during the 19th dynasty of ancient Egypt when the scribes compiled king lists such as the royal table of Sakkara and the royal canon of Turin and the name of a deceased pharaoh was unreadable, damaged, or completely erased. <s> The papyrus is divided into eleven columns, distributed as follows. <s> The names and positions of several kings are still being disputed, since the list is so badly damaged.

Castration (also known as orchidectomy) is any action, surgical, chemical, or otherwise, by which an individual loses use of the testicles: the male gonad. <s> Surgical castration is bilateral orchidectomy (excision of both testes), and chemical castration uses pharmaceutical drugs to deactivate the testes. <s> Castration causes sterilization (preventing the castrated person or animal from reproducing); it also greatly reduces the production of certain hormones, such as testosterone. <s> Surgical castration in animals is often called neutering. <s> Castration was frequently used for religious or social reasons in certain cultures in Europe, South Asia, Africa, and East Asia. <s> After battles in some cases, winners castrated their captives or the corpses of the defeated to symbolize their victory and seize their "power". <s> Castrated men â€” eunuchs â€“ were often admitted to special social classes and were used particularly to staff bureaucracies and palace households: in particular, the harem. <s> Castration also figured in a number of religious castration cults. <s> Other religions, such as Judaism, were strongly opposed to the practice. <s> The Leviticus Holiness code, for example, specifically excludes eunuchs or any males with defective genitals from the priesthood, just as castrated animals are excluded from sacrifice. <s> Eunuchs in China had been known to usurp power in many eras of Chinese history, most notably in the Later Han, late Tang and late Ming dynasties. <s> There are similar recorded Middle Eastern events. <s> Either surgical removal of both testicles or chemical castration may be carried out in the case of prostate cancer. <s> Testosterone-depletion treatment (either surgical removal of both testicles or chemical castration) is used to slow down the cancer, greatly reduce sex drive or interest in those with sexual drives, obsessions, or behaviors, or any combination of those that may be considered deviant. <s> Edward Gibbon's "Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire" reports castration of defeated foes at the hands of the Normans during their invasions of Sicily and Italy. <s> During the reign of Mu of the Zhou Dynasty (10th c. BCE) the Minister of Crime, Marquis Lu, reformed the law in 950 BC to make it easier for people to be sentenced to castration instead of death. <s> As long as the practice existed in China, not only were the testicles merely removed but castration included the severing of one's entire genitalia. <s> Both organs were cut off with a knife at the same time. <s> In Europe, when women were not permitted to sing in church or cathedral choirs in the Roman Catholic Church, boys were castrated to develop a special high voice and to prevent their voices breaking at puberty. <s> The first documents mentioning "castrati" are Italian church records from the 1550s. <s> In the baroque and classical music eras these singers were highly appreciated by opera composers as well. <s> Mozart's "Exultate Jubilate", Allegri's "Miserere" and other pieces from this period now sung by sopranos and countertenors were written for "castrati". <s> Some of the alto parts of Handel's Messiah were first sung by a "castrato". <s> "Castrati" include Farinelli, Senesino, Carestini, and Caffarelli. <s> The last true "castrato" was Alessandro Moreschi (1858â€“1922) who served in the Sistine Chapel Choir. <s> It was not until the late 19th century that the Roman Catholic Church officially condemned the production of "castrati". <s> In Modern times, the Mexican Javier Medina is the only professional opera singer that can perform as a castrato, since he suffered from an involuntary chemical castration, as a result from a cancer treatment that he had before he reached puberty. <s> Humans commonly castrate domestic animals not intended for breeding. <s> Domestic animals are usually castrated to avoid unwanted or uncontrolled reproduction; to reduce or prevent other manifestations of sexual behaviour such as defending the herd from humans and other threats, or intra-herd aggression (e.g. fighting between groups of entire (uncastrated) males of a species); or to reduce other consequences of sexual behavior that may make animal husbandry more difficult, such as boundary/fence/enclosure destruction when attempting to get to nearby females of the species. <s> Male horses are usually castrated (gelded) using emasculators, because stallions are rather aggressive and troublesome. <s> The same applies to male mules, although they are sterile. <s> Male cattle are castrated to improve fattening and docility in feedlots or for use as oxen. <s> Breeding individuals are kept entire and used for breeding: they may fetch higher prices when sold.

Syzygium cumini, commonly known as Malabar plum, Java plum, or black plum, is an evergreen tropical tree in the flowering plant family Myrtaceae. <s> It is native to the Indian Subcontinent, adjoining regions of Southeast Asia, China and Queensland. <s> The name of the fruit is sometimes mistranslated as blackberry, which is a different fruit in an unrelated order. <s> "Syzygium cumini" has been spread overseas from India by Indian emigrants and at present is common in tropical former British colonies. <s> The tree was introduced to Florida in 1911 by the USDA, and is also now commonly grown in Suriname, Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago. <s> In Brazil, where it was introduced from India during Portuguese colonization, it has dispersed spontaneously in the wild in some places, as its fruits are eagerly sought by various native birds such as thrushes, tanagers and the great kiskadee. <s> This species is considered an invasive in Hawaii. <s> A slow growing species, it can reach heights of up to 30 m and can live more than 100 years. <s> Its dense foliage provides shade and is grown just for its ornamental value. <s> At the base of the tree, the bark is rough and dark grey, becoming lighter grey and smoother higher up. <s> The wood is water resistant. <s> Because of this it is used in railway sleepers and to install motors in wells. <s> It is sometimes used to make cheap furniture and village dwellings though it is relatively hard to work on. <s> "Syzygium cumini" trees start flowering from March to April. <s> The flowers are fragrant and small, about 5 mm in diameter. <s> The fruits develop by May or June and resemble large berries; the fruit of "Syzygium" species is described as "drupaceous". <s> The fruit is oblong, ovoid. <s> Unripe fruit looks green. <s> As it matures, its color changes to pink, then to shining crimson red and finally to black color. <s> A variant of the tree produces white coloured fruit. <s> The fruit has a combination of sweet, mildly sour and astringent flavour and tends to colour the tongue purple. <s> The seed of the fruit is used in various alternative healing systems like Ayurveda, Unani and Chinese medicine. <s> Wine and vinegar are also made from the fruit. <s> It has a high source in vitamin A and vitamin C.

Friedrich August KekuleÌ, later Friedrich August Kekule von Stradonitz ( ; ] ; 7 September 1829 â€“ 13 July 1896), was a German organic chemist. <s> From the 1850s until his death, KekuleÌ was one of the most prominent chemists in Europe, especially in theoretical chemistry. <s> He was the principal founder of the theory of chemical structure. <s> The son of a civil servant, KekuleÌ was born in Darmstadt, the capital of the Grand Duchy of Hesse. <s> After graduating from secondary school (the Grand Ducal Gymnasium in Darmstadt), in the fall of 1847 he entered the University of Giessen, with the intention of studying architecture. <s> After hearing the lectures of Justus von Liebig in his first semester, he decided to study chemistry. <s> Following four years of study in Giessen and a brief compulsory military service, he took temporary assistantships in Paris (1851â€“52), in Chur, Switzerland (1852â€“53), and in London (1853â€“55), where he was decisively influenced by Alexander Williamson. <s> His Giessen doctoral degree was awarded in the summer of 1852. <s> In 1856 KekuleÌ became Privatdozent at the University of Heidelberg. <s> In 1858 he was hired as full professor at the University of Ghent, then in 1867 he was called to Bonn, where he remained for the rest of his career. <s> Basing his ideas on those of predecessors such as Williamson, Edward Frankland, William Odling, Auguste Laurent, Charles-Adolphe Wurtz and others, KekuleÌ was the principal formulator of the theory of chemical structure (1857â€“58). <s> This theory proceeds from the idea of atomic valence, especially the tetravalence of carbon (which KekuleÌ announced late in 1857) and the ability of carbon atoms to link to each other (announced in a paper published in May 1858), to the determination of the bonding order of all of the atoms in a molecule. <s> Archibald Scott Couper independently arrived at the idea of self-linking of carbon atoms (his paper appeared in June 1858), and provided the first molecular formulas where lines symbolize bonds connecting the atoms. <s> For organic chemists, the theory of structure provided dramatic new clarity of understanding, and a reliable guide to both analytic and especially synthetic work. <s> As a consequence, the field of organic chemistry developed explosively from this point. <s> Among those who were most active in pursuing early structural investigations were, in addition to KekuleÌ and Couper, Frankland, Wurtz, Alexander Crum Brown, Emil Erlenmeyer, and Alexander Butlerov. <s> KekuleÌ's most famous work was on the structure of benzene. <s> In 1865 KekuleÌ published a paper in French (for he was then still in Belgium) suggesting that the structure contained a six-membered ring of carbon atoms with alternating single and double bonds. <s> The following year he published a much longer paper in German on the same subject. <s> The empirical formula for benzene had been long known, but its highly unsaturated structure was a challenge to determine. <s> Archibald Scott Couper in 1858 and Joseph Loschmidt in 1861 suggested possible structures that contained multiple double bonds or multiple rings, but the study of aromatic compounds was in its earliest years, and too little evidence was then available to help chemists decide on any particular structure.

In [computer science], a for-loop (or simply for loop) is a [control flow] [statement (programming)|statement] for specifying [iteration], which allows code to be [execution (computers)|executed] repeatedly. <s> Various keywords are used to specify this statement: descendants of [ALGOL] use "for", while descendants of [Fortran] use "do". <s> There are other possibilities, for example [COBOL] which uses "PERFORM VARYING". <s> A for-loop has two parts: a header specifying the iteration, and a body which is executed once per iteration. <s> The header often declares an explicit [For_loop#Loop counters|loop counter] or loop variable, which allows the body to know which iteration is being executed. <s> For-loops are typically used when the number of iterations is known before entering the loop. <s> For-loops can be thought of as shorthands for while-loops which increment and test a loop variable. <s> The name "for-loop" comes from the English word [Wiktionary:for|for], which is used as the [Keyword (computing)|keyword] in many programming languages to introduce a for-loop. <s> The term in English dates to [ALGOL 58] and was popularized in the influential later [ALGOL 60]; it is the direct translation of the earlier German [wikt:fuÌˆr|fuÌˆr], used in "[Superplan]" (1949â€“1951) by [Heinz Rutishauser], who also was involved in defining ALGOL 58 and ALGOL 60. <s> The loop body is executed "for" the given values of the loop variable, though this is more explicit in the [ALGOL] version of the statement, in which a list of possible values and/or increments can be specified. <s> In [computer programming] a loop counter is the [variable (programming)|variable] that controls the iterations of a loop (a computer [programming language] construct). <s> It is so named because most uses of this construct result in the variable taking on a range of integer values in some orderly sequences (example., starting at 0 and end at 10 in increments of 1) <s> Loop counters change with each [iteration] of a loop, providing a unique value for each individual iteration. <s> The loop counter is used to decide when the loop should terminate and for the program flow to continue to the next [instruction (computer science)|instruction] after the loop. <s> A common [identifier naming convention] is for the loop counter to use the variable names i, j, and k (and so on if needed), where i would be the most outer loop, j the next inner loop, etc. <s> The reverse order is also used by some programmers.

Halophiles are organisms that thrive in high salt concentrations. <s> They are a type of extremophile organism. <s> The name comes from the Greek word for "salt-loving". <s> While most halophiles are classified into the Archaea domain, there are also bacterial halophiles and some eukaryota, such as the alga "Dunaliella salina" or fungus "Wallemia ichthyophaga". <s> Some well-known species give off a red color from carotenoid compounds, notably bacteriorhodopsin. <s> Halophiles can be found anywhere with a concentration of salt five times greater than the salt concentration of the ocean, such as the Great Salt Lake in Utah, Owens Lake in California, the Dead Sea, and in evaporation ponds. <s> Halophiles are categorized as slight, moderate, or extreme, by the extent of their halotolerance. <s> Slight halophiles prefer 0.3 to 0.8 M (1.7 to 4.8%â€”seawater is 0.6 M or 3.5%), moderate halophiles 0.8 to 3.4 M (4.7 to 20%), and extreme halophiles 3.4 to 5.1 M (20 to 30%) salt content. <s> Halophiles require sodium chloride (salt) for growth, in contrast to halotolerant organisms, which do not require salt but can grow under saline conditions. <s> High salinity represents an extreme environment to which relatively few organisms have been able to adapt and occupy. <s> Most halophilic and all halotolerant organisms expend energy to exclude salt from their cytoplasm to avoid protein aggregation ('salting out'). <s> To survive the high salinities, halophiles employ two differing strategies to prevent desiccation through osmotic movement of water out of their cytoplasm. <s> Both strategies work by increasing the internal osmolarity of the cell. <s> In the first (which is employed by the majority of halophilic bacteria, some archaea, yeasts, algae and fungi), organic compounds are accumulated in the cytoplasmâ€”osmoprotectants which are known as compatible solutes. <s> These can be either synthesised or accumulated from the environment. <s> The most common compatible solutes are neutral or zwitterionic, and include amino acids, sugars, polyols, betaines, and ectoines, as well as derivatives of some of these compounds. <s> The second, more radical adaptation involves the selective influx of potassium (K) ions into the cytoplasm. <s> This adaptation is restricted to the moderately halophilic bacterial order Halanaerobiales, the extremely halophilic archaeal family Halobacteriaceae, and the extremely halophilic bacterium "Salinibacter ruber". <s> The presence of this adaptation in three distinct evolutionary lineages suggests convergent evolution of this strategy, it being unlikely to be an ancient characteristic retained in only scattered groups or passed on through massive lateral gene transfer. <s> The primary reason for this is the entire intracellular machinery (enzymes, structural proteins, etc.) must be adapted to high salt levels, whereas in the compatible solute adaptation, little or no adjustment is required to intracellular macromolecules; in fact, the compatible solutes often act as more general stress protectants, as well as just osmoprotectants.

Ramsey theory, named after the British mathematician and philosopher Frank P. Ramsey, is a branch of mathematics that studies the conditions under which order must appear. <s> Problems in Ramsey theory typically ask a question of the form: "how many elements of some structure must there be to guarantee that a particular property will hold?" <s> More specifically, Ron Graham describes Ramsey theory as a "branch of combinatorics". <s> A typical result in Ramsey theory starts with some mathematical structure that is then cut into pieces. <s> How big must the original structure be in order to ensure that at least one of the pieces has a given interesting property? <s> This idea can be defined as partition regularity. <s> For example, consider a complete graph of order "n"; that is, there are "n" vertices and each vertex is connected to every other vertex by an edge. <s> A complete graph of order 3 is called a triangle. <s> Now colour every edge red or blue. <s> How large must "n" be in order to ensure that there is either a blue triangle or a red triangle? <s> It turns out that the answer is 6. <s> See the article on Ramsey's theorem for a rigorous proof. <s> Another way to express this result is as follows: at any party with at least six people, there are three people who are all either mutual acquaintances (each one knows the other two) or mutual strangers (each one does not know either of the other two). <s> See theorem on friends and strangers.

The Chicago River is a system of rivers and canals with a combined length of 156 mi that runs through the city of Chicago, including its center (the Chicago Loop). <s> Though not especially long, the river is notable because it is one of the reasons for Chicago's geographic importance: the related Chicago Portage is a link between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River Basin, and ultimately the Gulf of Mexico. <s> The river is represented on the Municipal Flag of Chicago by two horizontal blue stripes. <s> Its three branches serve as the inspiration for the Municipal Device, a three-branched, Y-shaped symbol that is found on many buildings and other structures throughout Chicago. <s> The Main Stem flows 1.5 mi west from the controlling works at Lake Michigan; passing beneath the Outer Drive, Columbus Drive, Michigan Avenue, Wabash Avenue, State Street, Dearborn Street, Clark Street, La Salle Street, Wells Street, and Franklin Street bridges "en route" to its confluence with the North Branch at Wolf Point. <s> At McClurg Court it passes the Nicholas J Melas Centennial Fountain, which was built in 1989 to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago; between May and October the fountain sends an arc of water over the river for ten minutes every hour. <s> On the north bank of the river, near the Chicago Landmark Michigan Avenue Bridge, is Pioneer Court, which marks the site of the homestead of Jean Baptiste Point du Sable who is recognized as the founder of Chicago. <s> On the south bank of the river is the site of Fort Dearborn, an army fort, first established in 1803. <s> Notable buildings surrounding this area include the NBC Tower, the Tribune Tower, and the Wrigley Building. <s> The river turns slightly to the south west between Michigan Avenue and State Street, passing the Trump International Hotel and Tower, 35 East Wacker, and 330 North Wabash. <s> Turning west again the river passes Marina City, the Reid, Murdoch & Co. <s> Building, and Merchandise Mart, and 333 Wacker Drive. <s> As part of a more than fifty-year-old Chicago tradition, the Chicago River is dyed green in observance of St. Patrick's Day. <s> The actual event does not necessarily occur on St. Patrick's Day and is scheduled for the Saturday before March 17, unless the 17th falls on a Saturday (when the event takes place on St. Patrick's Day). <s> For the Chicago Cubs rally and parade for their 2016 World Series Championship celebrations, the river was dyed Cubs blue.
The WaveBird Wireless Controller (stylized as WAVEBIRD, commonly abbreviated as WaveBird or WaveBird controller) is a radio frequency-based wireless controller manufactured by Nintendo for use with the Nintendo GameCube home video game console. <s> Its name is a reference to Dolphin, the GameCube's codename during development. <s> The WaveBird was available for purchase separately as well as in bundles with either "Metroid Prime" or "Mario Party 4", which were exclusive to Kmart in the US. <s> Radio Frequency controllers were not possible in the late 1980s as the early digital RF links were bulky and used too much power to be useful in battery-powered devices. <s> However, advancements in integrated circuits made radio controllers for game consoles commercially viable only a decade later. <s> The WaveBird, released in 2002, solved previous usability problems of wireless controllers by relying on radio frequency communication instead of infrared, allowing the controller to be used anywhere within 6 meters (20 ft) of the console. <s> Although Nintendo only certifies the WaveBird to work within this 6 meter (20 ft) range, tests have proven that they may work as far as 27.5 meters (90 ft) on all 16 different channels. <s> The WaveBird Wireless Controller maintains the same overall aesthetic design as the standard GameCube controller. <s> The components (analog sticks, buttons, and triggers) and layout remain the same, while adding wireless functionality and space for two standard AA batteries. <s> It is somewhat larger and heavier than a standard GameCube controller, with a channel selector dial, an on/off switch, and an orange LED power indicator on the face of the controller in place of the gap between the D-pad and the C-stick. <s> Functionally, the only feature the WaveBird controller lacks compared to the standard controller is the rumble feature, the motors of which would reduce battery life. <s> Like all GameCube controllers, the WaveBird Wireless Controller is compatible with the Wii, for use with GameCube and Virtual Console titles as well as certain Wii games and WiiWare titles. <s> Since the launch of the Wii, the WaveBird has seen increased popularity due to its ability to control these games wirelessly.

The sorites paradox ( ; sometimes known as the paradox of the heap) is a paradox that arises from vague predicates. <s> A typical formulation involves a heap of sand, from which grains are individually removed. <s> Under the assumption that removing a single grain does not turn a heap into a non-heap, the paradox is to consider what happens when the process is repeated enough times: is a single remaining grain still a heap? <s> If not, when did it change from a heap to a non-heap? <s> Another formulation is to start with a grain of sand, which is clearly not a heap, and then assume that adding a single grain of sand to something that is not a heap does not turn it into a heap. <s> Inductively, this process can be repeated as much as one wants without ever constructing a heap. <s> A more natural formulation of this variant is to assume a set of colored chips exists such that two adjacent chips vary in color too little for human eyesight to be able to distinguish between them.

A striptease is an erotic or exotic dance in which the performer gradually undresses, either partly or completely, in a seductive and sexually suggestive manner. <s> The person who performs a striptease is commonly known as a "stripper" or exotic dancer. <s> There is a stripping aspect in the ancient Sumerian myth of the descent of the goddess Inanna into the Underworld (or Kur). <s> At each of the seven gates, she removed an article of clothing or a piece of jewelry. <s> As long as she remained in hell, the earth was barren. <s> When she returned, fecundity abounded. <s> Some believe this myth was embodied in the dance of the seven veils of Salome, who danced for King Herod, as mentioned in the New Testament in Matthew 14:6 and Mark 6:21-22. <s> However, although the Bible records Salome's dance, the first mention of her removing seven veils occurs in Oscar Wilde's play of 'Salome', in 1893. <s> In ancient Greece, the lawgiver Solon established several classes of prostitutes in the late 6th century BC. <s> Among these classes of prostitutes were the auletrides: female dancers, acrobats, and musicians, noted for dancing naked in an alluring fashion in front of audiences of men. <s> In ancient Rome, dance featuring stripping was part of the entertainments "(ludi)" at the Floralia, an April festival in honor of the goddess Flora. <s> Empress Theodora, wife of 6th-century Byzantine emperor Justinian is reported by several ancient sources to have started in life as a courtesan and actress who performed in acts inspired from mythological themes and in which she disrobed "as far as the laws of the day allowed". <s> She was famous for her striptease performance of "Leda and the Swan". <s> From these accounts, it appears that the practice was hardly exceptional nor new. <s> It was, however, actively opposed by the Christian Church, which succeeded in obtaining statutes banning it in the following century. <s> The degree to which these statutes were subsequently enforced is, of course, opened to question. <s> What is certain is that no practice of the sort is reported in texts of the European Middle Ages. <s> Some claim the origin of the modern striptease lies in Oscar Wilde's play of 'Salome', in 1893. <s> In the Dance of the Seven Veils the female protagonist dances for King Herod and slowly removes her veils until she lies naked. <s> After Wilde's play and Richard Strauss's operatic version of the same, first performed in 1905, the erotic 'dance of the seven veils', became a standard routine for dancers in opera, vaudeville, film and burlesque. <s> A famous early practitioner was Maud Allan who in 1907 gave a private performance of the dance to King Edward VII. <s> In the 1880s and 1890s, Parisian shows such as the Moulin Rouge and Folies BergeÌ€re were featuring attractive scantily clad women dancing and tableaux vivants. <s> In this environment, an act in the 1890s featured a woman who slowly removed her clothes in a vain search for a flea crawling on her body. <s> "The People's Almanac" credits the act as the origin of modern striptease. <s> In 1905, the notorious and tragic Dutch dancer Mata Hari, later shot as a spy by the French authorities during World War I, was an overnight success from the debut of her act at the MuseÌe Guimet. <s> The most celebrated segment of her act was her progressive shedding of clothing until she wore just a jeweled bra and some ornaments over her arms and head. <s> Another landmark performance was the appearance at the Moulin Rouge in 1907 of an actress called Germaine Aymos, who entered dressed only in three very small shells. <s> In the 1920s and 1930s the famous Josephine Baker danced topless in the "danse sauvage" at the Folies and other such performances were provided at the Tabarin. <s> These shows were notable for their sophisticated choreography and often dressing the girls in glitzy sequins and feathers. <s> In his 1957 book "Mythologies", semiotician Roland Barthes interpreted this Parisian striptease as a "mystifying spectacle", a "reassuring ritual" where "evil is advertised the better to impede and exorcise it". <s> By the 1960s "fully nude" shows were provided at such places as Le Crazy Horse Saloon. <s> Also produced in 1965 was "Carousella", a documentary about Soho striptease artistes, directed by John Irvin. <s> Another documentary film, which looked at the unglamorous side of striptease, is the 1966 film called,"Strip", filmed at the Phoenix Club in Soho. <s> "Secrets of a Windmill Girl" (1966) featured Pauline Collins and April Wilding and was directed by Arnold L.

Emmeline Pankhurst (born Emiline Goulden; 15 July 1858 â€“ 14 June 1928) was a British political activist and organizer of the British suffragette movement who helped women win the right to vote. <s> In 1999 "Time" named Pankhurst as one of the , stating "she shaped an idea of women for our time; she shook society into a new pattern from which there could be no going back". <s> She was widely criticised for her militant tactics, and historians disagree about their effectiveness, but her work is recognised as a crucial element in achieving women's suffrage in the United Kingdom. <s> In 1903, Pankhurst founded the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), an all-women suffrage advocacy organisation dedicated to "deeds, not words". <s> The group identified as independent from â€“ and often in opposition to â€“ political parties. <s> It became known for physical confrontations: its members smashed windows and assaulted police officers. <s> Pankhurst, her daughters, and other WSPU activists received repeated prison sentences, where they staged hunger strikes to secure better conditions, and were often force-fed. <s> As Pankhurst's eldest daughter Christabel took leadership of the WSPU, antagonism between the group and the government grew. <s> Eventually the group adopted arson as a tactic, and more moderate organisations spoke out against the Pankhurst family. <s> In 1913 several prominent individuals left the WSPU, among them Pankhurst's younger daughters, Adela and Sylvia. <s> Emmeline was so furious that she "gave Adela a ticket, Â£20, and a letter of introduction to a suffragette in Australia, and firmly insisted that she emigrate". <s> Adela complied and the family rift was never healed. <s> Sylvia became a socialist. <s> With the advent of the First World War, Emmeline and Christabel called an immediate halt to militant suffrage terrorism in support of the British government's stand against the "German Peril". <s> They urged women to aid industrial production and encouraged young men to fight, becoming prominent figures in the white feather movement. <s> In 1918, the Representation of the People Act granted votes to all men over the age of 21 and women over the age of 30. <s> This discrepancy was intended to ensure that men did not become minority voters as a consequence of the huge number of deaths suffered during the First World War. <s> She transformed the WSPU machinery into the Women's Party, which was dedicated to promoting women's equality in public life. <s> In her later years, she became concerned with what she perceived as the menace posed by Bolshevism and joined the Conservative Party. <s> She was selected as the Conservative candidate for Whitechapel and St Georges in 1927. <s> She died on 14 June 1928, only weeks before the Conservative government's Representation of the People Act (1928) extended the vote to all women over 21 years of age on 2 July 1928. <s> She was commemorated two years later with a statue in Victoria Tower Gardens, next to the Houses of Parliament.

Bit-level parallelism is a form of parallel computing based on increasing processor word size. <s> Increasing the word size reduces the number of instructions the processor must execute in order to perform an operation on variables whose sizes are greater than the length of the word. <s> (For example, consider a case where an 8-bit processor must add two 16-bit integers. <s> The processor must first add the 8 lower-order bits from each integer, then add the 8 higher-order bits, requiring two instructions to complete a single operation. <s> A 16-bit processor would be able to complete the operation with single instruction.) <s> From the advent of very-large-scale integration (VLSI) computer chip fabrication technology in the 1970s until about 1986, advancements in computer architecture were done by increasing bit-level parallelism, as 4-bit microprocessors were replaced by 8-bit, then 16-bit, then 32-bit microprocessors. <s> This trend generally came to an end with the introduction of 32-bit processors, which were a standard in general purpose computing for two decades. <s> 64 bit architectures were introduced to the mainstream with the eponymous Nintendo 64 (1996), but beyond this introduction stayed uncommon until the advent of x86-64 architectures around the year 2003, and 2014 for mobile devices with the ARMv8-A instruction set.

Jackson County is a county located in the U.S. state of Florida, on its northwestern border with Alabama. <s> As of the 2010 census, the population was 49,746. <s> Its county seat is Marianna. <s> Jackson County was created by the Florida Territorial Council in 1822 out of Escambia County, at the same time that Duval County was organized from land of St. Johns County, making them the third and fourth counties in the Territory. <s> The county was named for General Andrew Jackson, a hero of the War of 1812, who had served as Florida's first military governor for six months in 1821. <s> Jackson County originally extended from the Choctawhatchee River on the west to the Suwannee River on the east. <s> By 1840 the county had been reduced close to its present boundaries through the creation of new counties from its original territory, following an increase of population in these areas. <s> Minor adjustments to the county boundaries continued through most of the 19th century, however. <s> There were no towns in Jackson County when it was formed. <s> The first county court met at what was called "Robinson's Big Spring" (later called Blue Springs) in 1822 and then at the "Big Spring of the Choctawhatchee" in 1823. <s> The following year the county court met at "Chipola Settlement", which is also known as Waddell's Mill Pond. <s> Gradually towns were developed. <s> In January 1821, Webbville had been established as the first town in Jackson County, and it was first designated as the county seat. <s> Marianna was founded by Robert Beveridge, a native of Scotland, in September 1821. <s> It developed about 9 mi southeast of Webbville. <s> The first county seat thrived until 1828, when Beveridge and other Marianna settlers went to Tallahassee to lobby for the county seat to be moved to Marianna. <s> They enticed the Florida Legislature with offers of free land, paying to construct a county courthouse and develop a public square, and donating an additional $500 to purchase a quarter section of land to be sold at public auction as a way to finance the new government, if the county seat was moved to Marianna. <s> Beveridge and his supporters succeeded in their civic bribe. <s> Marianna became the "de facto" county seat of the county justice and civil authority, although it was never officially proclaimed to be such. <s> Marianna began to grow and prosper when the county government moved into the new courthouse in 1829. <s> It became the market and court town for the rural county. <s> Webbville's prominent citizens moved to Marianna to follow the courts, as did numerous businesses. <s> When the L&N Railroad decided to bypass putting a station at Webbville, the town declined further and became defunct. <s> Tensions broke out into violence and in 1869 Jackson County became the center of a guerrilla war extending through 1871; it became known as the Jackson County War. <s> The local Ku Klux Klan, insurgent Confederate Army veterans, directed their violence at eradicating the Republican Party in the county, assassinating more than 150 Republican Party officials and other prominent African Americans as part of a successful campaign to retain white Democratic power in the county. <s> Another source says that in Jackson County, 200 "leading Republicans" were assassinated in 1869 and 1870 alone;

In logic, quantification specifies the quantity of specimens in the domain of discourse that satisfy an open formula. <s> The two most common quantifiers mean "for all" and "there exists". <s> For example, in arithmetic, quantifiers allow one to say that the natural numbers go on forever, by writing that "for all" n (where n is a natural number), there is another number (say, the successor of n) which is one bigger than n. <s> Two fundamental kinds of quantification in predicate logic are universal quantification and existential quantification. <s> The traditional symbol for the universal quantifier "all" is "âˆ€", a rotated letter "A", and for the existential quantifier "exists" is "âˆƒ", a rotated letter "E". <s> These quantifiers have been generalized beginning with the work of Mostowski and LindstroÌˆm. <s> Quantification is used as well in natural languages; examples of quantifiers in English are "for all", "for some", "many", "few", "a lot", and "no;" see Quantifier (linguistics) for details. <s> Consider the following statement: This has the appearance of an "infinite conjunction" of propositions. <s> From the point of view of formal languages this is immediately a problem, since syntax rules are expected to generate finite words. <s> The two most common quantifiers are the universal quantifier and the existential quantifier. <s> The traditional symbol for the universal quantifier is "âˆ€", a rotated letter "A", which stands for "for all" or "all". <s> The corresponding symbol for the existential quantifier is "âˆƒ", a rotated letter "E", which stands for "there exists" or "exists". <s> An example of translating a quantified statement in a natural language such as English would be as follows. <s> Given the statement, "Each of Peter's friends either likes to dance or likes to go to the beach," key aspects can be identified and rewritten using symbols including quantifiers. <s> So, let "X" be the set of all Peter's friends, "P"("x") the predicate ""x" likes to dance", and "Q"("x") the predicate ""x" likes to go to the beach". <s> Then the above sentence can be written in formal notation as formula_1, which is read, "for every "x" that is a member of "X", "P" applies to "x" or "Q" applies to "x"." <s> The order of quantifiers is critical to meaning, as is illustrated by the following two propositions: This is clearly true; it just asserts that every natural number has a square. <s> The meaning of the assertion in which the order of quantifiers is inversed is different: This is clearly false; it asserts that there is a single natural number "s" that is at the same time the square of "every" natural number. <s> This is because the syntax directs that any variable cannot be a function of subsequently introduced variables. <s> A few other quantifiers have been proposed over time. <s> In particular, the solution quantifier, noted Â§ (section sign) and read "those". <s> For example, is read "those "n" in N such that "n" â‰¤ 4 are in {0,1,2}." <s> The same construct is expressible in set-builder notation as <s> Term logic, also called Aristotelian logic, treats quantification in a manner that is closer to natural language, and also less suited to formal analysis. <s> Term logic treated "All", "Some" and "No" in the 4th century BC, in an account also touching on the alethic modalities. <s> Gottlob Frege, in his 1879 "Begriffsschrift", was the first to employ a quantifier to bind a variable ranging over a domain of discourse and appearing in predicates. <s> He would universally quantify a variable (or relation) by writing the variable over a dimple in an otherwise straight line appearing in his diagrammatic formulas. <s> Frege did not devise an explicit notation for existential quantification, instead employing his equivalent of ~âˆ€"x"~, or contraposition. <s> Frege's treatment of quantification went largely unremarked until Bertrand Russell's 1903 "Principles of Mathematics". <s> In work that culminated in Peirce (1885), Charles Sanders Peirce and his student Oscar Howard Mitchell independently invented universal and existential quantifiers, and bound variables. <s> Peirce and Mitchell wrote Î  and Î£ where we now write âˆ€"x" and âˆƒ"x". <s> Peirce's notation can be found in the writings of Ernst SchroÌˆder, Leopold Loewenheim, Thoralf Skolem, and Polish logicians into the 1950s. <s> Most notably, it is the notation of Kurt GoÌˆdel's landmark 1930 paper on the completeness of first-order logic, and 1931 paper on the incompleteness of Peano arithmetic. <s> Peirce's approach to quantification also influenced William Ernest Johnson and Giuseppe Peano, who invented yet another notation, namely ("x") for the universal quantification of "x" and (in 1897) âˆƒ"x" for the existential quantification of "x". <s> Hence for decades, the canonical notation in philosophy and mathematical logic was ("x")"P" to express "all individuals in the domain of discourse have the property "P"," and "(âˆƒ"x")"P"" for "there exists at least one individual in the domain of discourse having the property "P"." <s> Peano, who was much better known than Peirce, in effect diffused the latter's thinking throughout Europe. <s> Peano's notation was adopted by the "Principia Mathematica" of Whitehead and Russell, Quine, and Alonzo Church. <s> In 1935, Gentzen introduced the âˆ€ symbol, by analogy with Peano's âˆƒ symbol. <s> âˆ€ did not become canonical until the 1960s.

Adriaen Coorte (ca. 1665 â€“ after 1707) was a Dutch Golden Age painter of still lifes, who signed works between 1683 and 1707. <s> He painted small and unpretentious still lifes in a style more typical of the first half of the century, and was "one of the last practitioners of this intimate category". <s> Very little is known of his life, but he is assumed to have been born and died in Middelburg. <s> He became a pupil of Melchior d'Hondecoeter around 1680 in Amsterdam. <s> Hondecoeter is known for repetitions of certain birds in certain poses, and he apparently took on pupils who were set to work copying these into their compositions. <s> From 1683 he seems to have returned to Middelburg, where he set up a workshop and signed his small, carefully balanced minimalist still lifes. <s> He often painted on paper that was glued to a wooden panel. <s> About 80 signed works by him have been catalogued, and nearly all of them follow the same pattern; small arrangements of fruits, vegetables, or shells on a stone slab, lit from above, with the dark background typical of still lifes earlier in the century. <s> Instead of the Chinese or silver vessels favoured by his contemporaries, his tableware is very basic pottery. <s> "Objects and light are studied intensely, and are painted with a wondrous tenderness". <s> Neither his birth nor death date is certain, and archival evidence only exists in Middelburg for his membership in the Guild of St. Luke there from 1695 onwards, when he was fined for selling a painting without being a member of the guild. <s> His works appear frequently in contemporary Middelburg taxation inventories <s> Coorte was apparently not well known to his contemporaries outside the small city of Middelburg and, like Vermeer a century before, he was almost entirely forgotten until the 1950s, when the Dutch art historian Laurens J. Bol revived his reputation, beginning with an article in 1952, and finally publishing the first monograph and "catalogue raisonneÌ" on Coorte in 1977 ("Adriaen Coorte", Amsterdam). <s> Bol arranged an exhibition of 35 examples of Coorte's work in 1958 at the Dordrechts Museum, which became a sensation in the Netherlands, with the poets Hans Faverey and Ed Leeflang both being inspired by the paintings. <s> In 2003 there was an exhibition at the National Gallery of Art, Washington. <s> In 2008 a new travelling exhibition was set up; "Ode to Coorte", that was as nearly as successful, making Coorte the most celebrated "rediscovered" Dutch Baroque painter of recent decades. <s> Testifying to Coorte's recent popularity is the December 1st, 2009 auction of two of his new-found paintings, which each sold for more than ten times the estimated price.

A syllogism (Greek: "syllogismos", "conclusion, inference") is a kind of logical argument that applies deductive reasoning to arrive at a conclusion based on two or more propositions that are asserted or assumed to be true. <s> In antiquity, two rival theories of the syllogism existed: Aristotelian syllogistic and Stoic syllogistic. <s> Aristotle defines the syllogism as "a discourse in which certain (specific) things having been supposed, something different from the things supposed results of necessity because these things are so". <s> Despite this very general definition, in "Prior Analytics" Aristotle limits himself to categorical syllogisms that consist of three categorical propositions. <s> These include categorical modal syllogisms. <s> Within academic contexts, the syllogism was superseded by first-order predicate logic following the work of Gottlob Frege, in particular his "Begriffsschrift" ("Concept Script") (1879), but syllogisms remain useful in some circumstances, and for general-audience introductions to logic. <s> Each of the three distinct terms represents a category. <s> In the above example, "humans", "mortal", and "Greeks". <s> "Mortal" is the major term, "Greeks" the minor term. <s> The premises also have one term in common with each other, which is known as the "middle term"; in this example, "humans". <s> Both of the premises are universal, as is the conclusion. <s> Here, the major term is "die", the minor term is "men", and the middle term is "mortals". <s> Again, both premises are universal, hence so is the conclusion. <s> A sorites is a form of argument in which a series of incomplete syllogisms is so arranged that the predicate of each premise forms the subject of the next until the subject of the first is joined with the predicate of the last in the conclusion. <s> For example, one might argue that all lions are big cats, all big cats are predators, and all predators are carnivores. <s> To conclude that therefore all lions are carnivores is to construct a sorites argument.

Professor (commonly abbreviated as Prof.) is an academic rank at universities and other post-secondary education and research institutions in most countries. <s> Literally, "professor" derives from Latin as a "person who professes" being usually an expert in arts or sciences, a teacher of the highest rank. <s> In most systems of academic ranks the word "professor" only refers to the most senior academic position, sometimes informally known as "full professor". <s> In some countries or institutions, the word "professor" is also used in titles of lower ranks such as associate professor and assistant professor; this is particularly the case in the United States, where the word professor is sometimes used colloquially to refer to anyone in an academic post. <s> This colloquial usage would be considered incorrect among most other academic communities. <s> However, the unqualified title Professor designated with a capital letter usually refers to a full professor also in English language usage. <s> Professors often conduct original research and commonly teach undergraduate, professional and postgraduate courses in their fields of expertise. <s> In universities with graduate schools, professors may mentor and supervise graduate students conducting research for a thesis or dissertation. <s> In many universities, 'full professors' take on senior managerial roles, leading departments, research teams and institutes, and filling roles such as president, principal or vice-chancellor. <s> The role of professor may be more public facing than that of more junior staff, and professors are expected to be national or international leaders in their field of expertise. <s> A professor is an accomplished and recognized academic. <s> In most Commonwealth nations, as well as northern Europe, the title "professor" is the highest academic rank at a university. <s> In the United States and Canada, the title of "professor" applies to most post-doctoral academics, so a larger percentage are thus designated. <s> In these areas, professors are scholars with doctorate degrees (typically Ph.D. degrees) or equivalent qualifications who teach in four-year colleges and universities. <s> An emeritus professor is a title given to selected retired professors with whom the university wishes to continue to be associated due to their stature and ongoing research. <s> Emeritus professors do not receive a salary, but they are often given office or lab space, and use of libraries, labs, and so on. <s> The term professor is also used in the titles "assistant professor" and "associate professor", which are not considered professor-level positions in all European countries. <s> In Australia, the title "associate professor" is used in place of the term "reader" as used in the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth countries; ranking above senior lecturer and below full professor. <s> Beyond holding the proper academic title, universities in many countries also give notable artists, athletes and foreign dignitaries the title "honorary professor", even if these persons do not have the academic qualifications typically necessary for professorship and they do not take up professorial duties. <s> However, such "professors" usually do not undertake academic work for the granting institution. <s> In general, the title of professor is strictly used for academic positions rather than for those holding it on honorary basis. <s> A professor typically earns a base salary and a range of benefits. <s> In addition, a professor who undertakes additional roles in their institution (e.g., department chair, dean, head of graduate studies, etc.) earns additional income. <s> Some professors also earn additional income by moonlighting in other jobs, such as consulting, publishing academic or popular press books, giving speeches, or coaching executives. <s> Some fields (e.g., business and computer science) give professors more opportunities for outside work. <s> The table below shows the final reference wages (per month or year?) <s> expressed in net amounts of Dutch Euros in 2014. <s> (i.e., converted into Dutch purchasing power). <s> In a number of countries, the title "research professor" refers to a professor who is exclusively or mainly engaged in research, and who has few or no teaching obligations. <s> For example, the title is used in this sense in the United Kingdom (where it is known as research professor at some universities and professorial research fellow at some other institutions) and in northern Europe. <s> Research professor is usually the most senior rank of a research-focused career pathway in those countries, and regarded as equal to the ordinary full professor rank. <s> Most often they are permanent employees, and the position is often held by particularly distinguished scholars; thus the position is often seen as more prestigious than an ordinary full professorship.

In 1855, two English scientists, Joseph Dalton Hooker and Edward William Binney, made the first scientific description of coal balls in England, and the initial research on coal balls was carried out in Europe. <s> North American coal balls were discovered and identified in 1922. <s> Coal balls have since been found in other countries, leading to the discovery of hundreds of species and genera. <s> Coal balls may be found in coal seams across North America and Eurasia. <s> North American coal balls are more widespread, both stratigraphically and geologically, than those in Europe. <s> The oldest known coal balls date from the Namurian stage of the Carboniferous; they were found in Germany and on the territory of former Czechoslovakia. <s> Marie Stopes and David Watson analysed coal ball samples and decided that coal balls formed "in situ". <s> They stressed the importance of interaction with seawater, believing that it was necessary for the formation of coal balls. <s> Some supporters of the "in situ" theory believe that Stopes' and Watson's discovery of a plant stem extending through multiple coal balls shows that coal balls formed "in situ", stating that the drift theory fails to explain Stopes' and Watson's observation. <s> They also cite fragile pieces of organic material projecting outside some coal balls, contending that if the drift theory was correct, the projections would have been destroyed, and some large coal balls are large enough that they could never have been able to be transported in the first place. <s> Coal balls are not made of coal; they are non-flammable and useless for fuel. <s> Coal balls are calcium-rich permineralised life forms, mostly containing calcium and magnesium carbonates, pyrite, and quartz. <s> Other minerals, including gypsum, illite, kaolinite, and lepidocrocite also appear in coal balls, albeit in lesser quantities. <s> Although coal balls are usually about the size of a man's fist, their sizes vary greatly, ranging from that of a walnut up to 3 ft in diameter. <s> Coal balls have been found that were smaller than a thimble. <s> In 1962, Sergius Mamay and Ellis Yochelson analysed North American coal balls. <s> Their discovery of marine organisms led to classification of coal balls were sorted into three types: normal (sometimes known as floral), containing only plant matter; faunal, containing animal fossils only; and mixed, containing both plant and animal material. <s> Mixed coal balls are further divided into heterogeneous, where the plant and animal material was distinctly separated; and homogeneous, lacking that separation. <s> Three main factors determine the quality of preserved material in a coal ball: the mineral constituents, the speed of the burial process, and the degree of compression before undergoing permineralisation. <s> Generally, coal balls resulting from remains that have a quick burial with little decay and pressure are better preserved, although plant remains in most coal balls almost always show differing signs of decay and collapse. <s> Coal balls containing quantities of iron sulfide have far lower preservation than coal balls permineralised by magnesium or calcium carbonate, which has earned iron sulfide the title "chief curse of the coal ball hunter". <s> Thin sectioning was an early procedure used to analyse fossilised material contained in coal balls. <s> The process required cutting a coal ball with a diamond saw, then flattening and polishing the thin section with an abrasive. <s> It would be glued to a slide and placed under a petrographic microscope for examination. <s> Although the process could be done with a machine, the large amount of time needed and the poor quality of samples produced by thin sectioning gave way to a more convenient method. <s> The thin section technique was superseded by the now-common liquid-peel technique in 1928. <s> In this technique, peels are obtained by cutting the surface of a coal ball with a diamond saw, grinding the cut surface on a glass plate with silicon carbide to a smooth finish, and etching the cut and the surface with hydrochloric acid.

An ecosystem is a community of living organisms in conjunction with the nonliving components of their environment, interacting as a system. <s> These biotic and abiotic components are linked together through nutrient cycles and energy flows. <s> Energy enters the system through photosynthesis and is incorporated into plant tissue. <s> By feeding on plants and on one-another, animals play an important role in the movement of matter and energy through the system. <s> They also influence the quantity of plant and microbial biomass present. <s> By breaking down dead organic matter, decomposers release carbon back to the atmosphere and facilitate nutrient cycling by converting nutrients stored in dead biomass back to a form that can be readily used by plants and other microbes. <s> Primary production is the production of organic matter from inorganic carbon sources. <s> This mainly occurs through photosynthesis. <s> The energy incorporated through this process supports life on earth, while the carbon makes up much of the organic matter in living and dead biomass, soil carbon and fossil fuels. <s> It also drives the carbon cycle, which influences global climate via the greenhouse effect. <s> Through the process of photosynthesis, plants capture energy from light and use it to combine carbon dioxide and water to produce carbohydrates and oxygen. <s> The photosynthesis carried out by all the plants in an ecosystem is called the gross primary production (GPP). <s> About half of the GPP is consumed in plant respiration. <s> The remainder, that portion of GPP that is not used up by respiration, is known as the net primary production (NPP). <s> Total photosynthesis is limited by a range of environmental factors. <s> These include the amount of light available, the amount of leaf area a plant has to capture light (shading by other plants is a major limitation of photosynthesis), rate at which carbon dioxide can be supplied to the chloroplasts to support photosynthesis, the availability of water, and the availability of suitable temperatures for carrying out photosynthesis. <s> Ecosystems are dynamic entities. <s> They are subject to periodic disturbances and are in the process of recovering from some past disturbance.

Jarylo (Cyrillic: Ð¯Ñ€Ð¸Ð»Ð¾ or Ð¯Ñ€Ð¸Ð»Ð°; ; , ÐˆÐ°Ñ€Ð¸Ð»Ð¾; ), alternatively Yarylo, Iarilo, or Gerovit, is a Slavic god of vegetation, fertility and springtime. <s> The only historic source that mentions this deity is a 12th-century biography of the proselytizing German bishop Otto of Bamberg, who, during his expeditions to convert the pagan tribes of Wendish and Polabian Slavs, encountered festivals in honor of the war-god Gerovit in the cities of Wolgast and Havelberg. <s> Gerovit is most likely a German corruption of the original Slavic name "Jarovit". <s> Up until the 19th century in Russia, Belarus and Serbia, folk festivals called "Jarilo" were celebrated in late spring or early summer. <s> Early researchers of Slavic mythology recognised in them relics of pagan ceremonies in honor of an eponymous spring deity. <s> In Northern Croatia and Southern Slovenia, especially White Carniola, similar spring festivals were called "Jurjevo" or "Zeleni Juraj" or "Zeleni Jurij" (Green George), nominally dedicated to St. George, and fairly similar to the Jarilo festivals of other Slavic nations.

The Boeing 80 was an American airliner of the 1920s. <s> A three-engined biplane, the Model 80 was built by the Boeing Airplane Company for Boeing's own airline, Boeing Air Transport, successfully carrying both airmail and passengers on scheduled services. <s> Boeing Air Transport was formed on February 17, 1927 by William Boeing to operate the Contract Air Mail (CAM) service between San Francisco and Chicago (CAM.18), taking over the route on July 1, 1927. <s> The route was initially operated by single-engined Boeing 40A biplanes, which could carry four passengers, which provided a useful supplement to the subsidized revenue from carrying airmail. <s> In order to take better advantage of passenger traffic, Boeing decided that it needed a larger aircraft that was more suitable for passenger carrying, and in early 1928 designed a trimotor aircraft capable of carrying 12 passengers, the Model 80. <s> Unlike the Fokker F-10 and Ford Trimotors operated by other U.S. airlines, the Model 80 was a biplane, chosen to give good takeoff and landing performance when operating from difficult airfields on its routes, many of which were at relatively high altitude. <s> The fuselage was of fabric covered steel and aluminium tube construction, and carried its 12 passengers in three-abreast seating in a well-appointed cabin. <s> The flight crew of two sat in an enclosed flight deck forward of the passenger cabin. <s> The wings were of fabric covered steel and duralumin construction, with detachable wingtips to aid storage in hangars. <s> The first Model 80, powered by three Pratt & Whitney Wasp radial engines, flew on July 27, 1928. <s> It was followed by three more Model 80s before production switched to the improved Model 80A, which was longer, allowing 18 passengers to be carried, and was powered by more powerful Pratt & Whitney Hornet engines, first flying on July 18, 1929 and receiving its airworthiness certificate on August 20, 1929. <s> The Model 80 carried out its first scheduled mail and passenger service for Boeing Air Transport on September 20, 1928, and soon proved successful. <s> The improved Model 80A entered service in September 1929. <s> In May 1930, Boeing Air Transport introduced female flight attendants, hiring eight including chief stewardess Ellen Church; all were unmarried registered nurses. <s> Flights carrying stewardesses began on May 15. <s> The Model 80 and 80A remained in service with Boeing Air Transport (later renamed United Airlines) until replaced by the Boeing 247 twin-engined monoplane in 1934. <s> A single Model 80A-1, modified as a freighter for use in Alaska, was salvaged from a dump at Anchorage Airport in 1960, and following restoration is now on display at the Museum of Flight in Seattle. <s> "Data from" Boeing Aircraft since 1916General characteristics* Crew: Three* Capacity: 18 passengers* Payload: 898 lb cargo (408 kg) air-cooled radials, 525 hp (392 kW) each Performance )* Service ceiling: 14,000 ft (4,270 m)* Rate of climb: 900 ft/min (4.6 m/s)
Hans Guido Freiherr von BuÌˆlow (January 8, 1830February 12, 1894) was a German conductor, virtuoso pianist, and composer of the Romantic era. <s> As one of the most distinguished conductors of the 19th century, his activity was critical for establishing the successes of several major composers of the time, especially Richard Wagner and Johannes Brahms. <s> Alongside Carl Tausig, BuÌˆlow was perhaps the most prominent of the early students of Hungarian virtuoso pianist, conductor and composer Franz Lisztâ€”therein performed the first public performance of Liszt's Sonata in B minor in 1857. <s> He became acquainted with, fell in love and eventually married Liszt's daughter Cosima, who later left him for Wagner. <s> Noted for his interpretation of the works of Ludwig van Beethoven, he was one of the earliest European musicians to tour the United States. <s> BuÌˆlow was born in Dresden, to members of the prominent BuÌˆlow family. <s> From the age of nine, he was a student of Friedrich Wieck (the father of Clara Schumann). <s> However, his parents insisted that he study law instead of music, and they sent him to Leipzig. <s> There he met Franz Liszt, and on hearing some music of Richard Wagnerâ€”specifically, the premiere of "Lohengrin" in 1850â€”he decided to ignore the dictates of his parents and make himself a career in music instead. <s> He studied the piano in Leipzig with the famous pedagogue Louis Plaidy. <s> He obtained his first conducting job in Zurich, on Wagner's recommendation, in 1850. <s> BuÌˆlow had a strongly acerbic personality and a loose tongue; this alienated many musicians whom he worked with. <s> He was dismissed from his Zurich job for this reason, but at the same time he was beginning to win renown for his ability to conduct new and complex works without a score. <s> In 1851, he became a student of Liszt, marrying his daughter Cosima in 1857. <s> They had two daughters: Daniela, born in 1860 and Blandina, born in 1863. <s> During the 1850s and early 1860s he was active as a pianist, conductor, and writer, and became well known throughout Germany as well as Russia. <s> In 1857, he premiered Liszt's Piano Sonata in B minor in Berlin. <s> In 1864 he became the Hofkapellmeister in Munich, and it was at this post he achieved his principal renown. <s> He conducted the premieres of two Wagner operas, "Tristan und Isolde" and "Die Meistersinger von NuÌˆrnberg", in 1865 and 1868 respectively; both were immensely successful. <s> Meanwhile, however, Cosima had been carrying on an affair with Richard Wagner and gave birth to their daughter Isolde in 1865. <s> Two years later, they had another daughter, Eva. <s> Although Cosima and Wagner's affair was now open knowledge, BuÌˆlow still refused to grant his wife a divorce. <s> Finally, she gave birth to one final childâ€“â€“a son, Siegfriedâ€“â€“and it was only then that the conductor at last relented. <s> Their divorce was finalized in 1870, after which Cosima and Wagner married. <s> BuÌˆlow never spoke to Wagner again and he did not see his former wife for 11 years afterwards, although he apparently continued to respect the composer on a professional level, as he still conducted his works and mourned Wagner's death in 1883. <s> In July 1882 he married the actress Marie Schanzer. <s> In addition to championing the music of Wagner, BuÌˆlow was a supporter of the music of both Brahms and Tchaikovsky. <s> He was the soloist in the world premiere of the Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto No. 1 in B-flat minor in Boston in 1875. <s> He was also a devotee of FreÌdeÌric Chopin's music; he came up with epithets for all of Chopin's Opus 28 Preludes, but these have generally fallen into disuse. <s> On the other hand, the D-flat major Prelude No. 15 is widely known by his title, the "Raindrop." <s> He was the first to perform (from memory) the complete cycle of Beethoven's piano sonatas, and with Sigmund Lebert, he co-produced an edition of the sonatas. <s> From 1878 to 1880 he was Hofkapellmeister in Hanover but was forced to leave after fighting with a tenor singing the "Knight of the Swan "Schwan"" role in "Lohengrin"; BuÌˆlow had called him the "Knight of the Swine "Schwein"". <s> In 1880 he moved to Meiningen where he took the equivalent post, and where he built the Meiningen Court Orchestra into one of the finest in Germany; among his other demands, he insisted that the musicians learn to play all their parts from memory. <s> It was during his five years in Meiningen that he met Richard Strauss (though the meeting actually took place in Berlin). <s> His first opinion of the young composer was not favorable, but he changed his mind when he was confronted with a sample of Strauss's "Serenade". <s> Later on, he used his influence to give Strauss his first regular employment as a conductor. <s> Like Strauss, BuÌˆlow was attracted to the ideas of Max Stirner, whom he reputedly had known personally. <s> In April 1892 BuÌˆlow closed his final performance with the Berlin Philharmonic (where he had been serving as Principal Conductor since 1887) with a speech "exalting" the ideas of Stirner. <s> Together with John Henry Mackay, Stirner's biographer, he placed a memorial plaque at Stirner's last residence in Berlin. <s> Some of his orchestral innovations included the addition of the five-string bass and the pedal timpani; the pedal timpani have since become standard instruments in the symphony orchestra. <s> His accurate, sensitive, and profoundly musical interpretations established him as the prototype of the virtuoso conductors who flourished at a later date. <s> He was also an astute and witty musical journalist. <s> In the late 1880s he settled in Hamburg, but continued to tour, both conducting and performing on the piano. <s> BuÌˆlow suffered from chronic neuralgiforme headaches, which were caused by a tumor of the cervical radicular nerves. <s> After about 1890 his mental and physical health began to fail, and he sought a warmer, drier climate for recovery; he died in a hotel in Cairo, Egypt at the age of 64, only ten months after his final concert performance.

The First Boer War ( , literally "First Freedom War"), also known as the First Anglo-Boer War, the Transvaal War or the Transvaal Rebellion, was a war fought from 16 December 1880 until 23 March 1881 between the United Kingdom and Boers of the Transvaal (as the South African Republic was known while under British administration). <s> The war resulted in Britainâ€™s accession to the establishment of the Second Republic. <s> In the 19th century a series of events occurred in the southern part of the African continent, with the British from time to time attempting to set up a single unified state there, while at other times wanting to control less territory. <s> Following the Battle of Blaauwberg (1806) Britain had officially acquired the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa from the Dutch in 1815 after the Napoleonic Wars. <s> Certain groups of Dutch-speaking settler farmers ("Boers") resented British rule, even though British control brought some economic benefits. <s> Successive waves of migrations of Boer farmers (known as "Trekboers" which literally means "transhumant farmers"), probed first east along the coast away from the Cape toward Natal, and thereafter north toward the interior, eventually establishing the republics that came to be known as the Orange Free State and the Transvaal (literally "across/beyond the Vaal River"). <s> The Trekboers were farmers, gradually extending their range and territory with no overall agenda. <s> The formal abolition of slavery in the British Empire in 1834 led to more organised groups of Boer settlers attempting to escape British rule, some travelling as far north as modern-day Mozambique. <s> This became known as the Great Trek, and those who took part in it are called Voortrekkers.

Heliocentrism is the astronomical model in which the Earth and planets revolve around the Sun at the center of the Solar System. <s> Historically, heliocentrism was opposed to geocentrism, which placed the Earth at the center. <s> The notion that the Earth revolves around the Sun had been proposed as early as the 3rd century BC by Aristarchus of Samos, but at least in the medieval world, Aristarchus's heliocentrism attracted little attentionâ€”possibly because of the loss of scientific works of the Hellenistic Era. <s> It was not until the 16th century that a mathematical model of a heliocentric system was presented, by the Renaissance mathematician, astronomer, and Catholic cleric Nicolaus Copernicus, leading to the Copernican Revolution. <s> In the following century, Johannes Kepler introduced elliptical orbits, and Galileo Galilei presented supporting observations made using a telescope. <s> Nicolaus Copernicus in his "De revolutionibus orbium coelestium" ("On the revolution of heavenly spheres", first printed in 1543 in Nuremberg), presented a discussion of a heliocentric model of the universe in much the same way as Ptolemy in the 2nd century had presented his geocentric model in his "Almagest". <s> Copernicus discussed the philosophical implications of his proposed system, elaborated it in geometrical detail, used selected astronomical observations to derive the parameters of his model, and wrote astronomical tables which enabled one to compute the past and future positions of the stars and planets.

Interest, in finance and economics, is payment from a borrower or deposit-taking financial institution to a lender or depositor of an amount above repayment of the principal sum (that is, the amount borrowed), at a particular rate. <s> It is distinct from a fee which the borrower may pay the lender or some third party. <s> It is also distinct from dividend which is paid by a company to its shareholders (owners) from its profit or reserve, but not at a particular rate decided beforehand, rather on a pro rata basis as a share in the reward gained by risk taking entrepreneurs when the revenue earned exceeds the total costs. <s> The rate of interest is equal to the interest amount paid or received over a particular period divided by the principal sum borrowed or lent (usually expressed as a percentage). <s> Compound interest means that interest is earned on prior interest in addition to the principal. <s> Due to compounding, the total amount of debt grows exponentially, and its mathematical study led to the discovery of the number "e". <s> In practice, interest is most often calculated on a daily, monthly, or yearly basis, and its impact is influenced greatly by its compounding rate.

Lake Baikal ( ; Russian: , ; , "Baigal nuur"; , "Baigal nuur", etymologically meaning, in Mongolian, "the Nature Lake") is a rift lake in Russia, located in southern Siberia, between Irkutsk Oblast to the northwest and the Buryat Republic to the southeast. <s> Lake Baikal is the largest freshwater lake by volume in the world, containing 22â€“23% of the world's fresh surface water. <s> With 23615.39 km3 of fresh water, it contains more water than the North American Great Lakes combined. <s> With a maximum depth of 1642 m , Baikal is the world's deepest lake. <s> It is considered among the world's clearest lakes and is considered the world's oldest lake â€“ at 25â€“30 million years. <s> It is the seventh-largest lake in the world by surface area. <s> Like Lake Tanganyika, Lake Baikal was formed as an ancient rift valley, having the typical long, crescent shape with a surface area of 31722 km2 . <s> Baikal is home to thousands of species of plants and animals, many of which exist nowhere else in the world. <s> The lake was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. <s> It is also home to Buryat tribes who reside on the eastern side of Lake Baikal, raising goats, camels, cattle, sheep, and horses, where the mean temperature varies from a winter minimum of -19 Â°C to a summer maximum of 14 Â°C . <s> Lake Baikal is in a rift valley, created by the Baikal Rift Zone, where the Earth's crust is slowly pulling apart. <s> At 636 km long and 79 km wide, Lake Baikal has the largest surface area of any freshwater lake in Asia, at 31722 km2 , and is the deepest lake in the world at 1642 m . <s> The bottom of the lake is 1186.5 m below sea level, but below this lies some 7 km of sediment, placing the rift floor some 8 - below the surface, the deepest continental rift on Earth. <s> In geological terms, the rift is young and active â€“ it widens about 2 cm (0.8 in) per year. <s> The fault zone is also seismically active; hot springs occur in the area and notable earthquakes happen every few years. <s> The lake is divided into three basins: North, Central, and South, with depths about 900 m , 1600 m , and 1400 m , respectively. <s> Fault-controlled accommodation zones rising to depths about 300 m separate the basins. <s> The North and Central basins are separated by Academician Ridge, while the area around the Selenga Delta and the Buguldeika Saddle separates the Central and South basins. <s> The lake drains into the Angara tributary of the Yenisei. <s> Notable landforms include Cape Ryty on Baikal's northwest coast. <s> Baikal's age is estimated at 25â€“30 million years, making it the most ancient lake in geological history. <s> It is unique among large, high-latitude lakes, as its sediments have not been scoured by overriding continental ice sheets. <s> Russian, U.S., and Japanese cooperative studies of deep-drilling core sediments in the 1990s provide a detailed record of climatic variation over the past 6.7 million years. <s> Longer and deeper sediment cores are expected in the near future. <s> Lake Baikal is the only confined freshwater lake in which direct and indirect evidence of gas hydrates exists. <s> The lake is completely surrounded by mountains. <s> The Baikal Mountains on the north shore, the Barguzin Range on the northeastern shore, and the taiga are technically protected as a national park. <s> It contains 27 islands; the largest, Olkhon, is 72 km long and is the third-largest lake-bound island in the world. <s> The lake is fed by as many as 330 inflowing rivers. <s> The main ones draining directly into Baikal are the Selenga River, the Barguzin River, the Upper Angara River, the Turka River, the Sarma River, and the Snezhnaya River. <s> It is drained through a single outlet, the Angara River. <s> Lake Baikal is rich in biodiversity. <s> It hosts more than 1,000 species of plants and 2,500 species of animals based on current knowledge, but the actual figures for both groups are believed to be significantly higher. <s> More than 80% of the animals are endemic. <s> The Baikal seal or "nerpa" ("Pusa sibirica") is found throughout Lake Baikal. <s> It is one of only three entirely freshwater seal populations in the world, the other two being subspecies of ringed seals. <s> Fewer than 65 native fish species occur in the lake basin, but more than half of these are endemic. <s> The families Abyssocottidae (deep-water sculpins), Comephoridae (golomyankas or Baikal oilfish), and Cottocomephoridae (Baikal sculpins) are entirely restricted to the lake basin. <s> All these are part of the Cottoidea and are typically less than 20 cm long. <s> Of particular note are the two species of golomyanka ("Comephorus baicalensis" and "C. dybowskii"). <s> These long-finned, translucent fish typically live in open water at depths of 100 - , but occur both shallower and much deeper. <s> Together with certain abyssocottid sculpins, they are the deepest living freshwater fish in the world, occurring to near the bottom of Lake Baikal. <s> The golomyankas are the primary prey of the Baikal seal and represent the largest fish biomass in the lake. <s> Beyond members of Cottoidea, there are few endemic fish species in the lake basin. <s> The most important local species for fisheries is the omul ("Coregonus migratorius"), an endemic whitefish. <s> It is caught, smoked, and then sold widely in markets around the lake. <s> Also, a second endemic whitefish inhabits the lake, "C. baicalensis".

In cryptography, a pre-shared key (PSK) is a shared secret which was previously shared between the two parties using some secure channel before it needs to be used. <s> To build a key from shared secret, the key derivation function is typically used. <s> Such systems almost always use symmetric key cryptographic algorithms. <s> The term PSK is used in Wi-Fi encryption such as Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA), where the method is called WPA-PSK or WPA2-PSK, and also in the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), where it is known as EAP-PSK. <s> In all these cases, both the wireless access points (AP) and all clients "share" the same key. <s> The characteristics of this secret or key are determined by the system which uses it; some system designs require that such keys be in a particular format. <s> It can be a password, a passphrase, or a hexadecimal string. <s> The secret is used by all systems involved in the cryptographic processes used to secure the traffic between the systems. <s> Crypto systems rely on one or more keys for confidentiality. <s> One particular attack is always possible against keys, the brute force key space search attack. <s> A sufficiently long, randomly chosen, key can resist any practical brute force attack, though not in principle if an attacker has sufficient computational power (see password strength and password cracking for more discussion). <s> Unavoidably, however, pre-shared keys are held by both parties to the communication, and so can be compromised at one end, without the knowledge of anyone at the other. <s> There are several tools available to help one choose strong passwords, though doing so over any network connection is inherently unsafe as one cannot in general know who, if anyone, may be eavesdropping on the interaction. <s> Choosing keys used by cryptographic algorithms is somewhat different in that any pattern whatsoever should be avoided, as any such pattern may provide an attacker with a lower effort attack than brute force search.

IC 10 is an irregular galaxy in the constellation Cassiopeia. <s> It was discovered by Lewis Swift in 1887 and in 1935 Nicholas Mayall became the first to suggest that the object is extragalactic. <s> Edwin Hubble suspected it might belong to the Local Group of galaxies, but its status remained uncertain for decades. <s> The radial velocity of IC 10 was measured in 1962, and it was found to be approaching the Milky Way at approximately 350 km/s, strengthening the evidence for its membership in the Local Group. <s> Its membership in the group was finally confirmed in 1996 by direct measurements of its distance based on observations of Cepheids. <s> Despite its closeness, the galaxy is rather difficult to study because it lies near the plane of the Milky Way and is therefore heavily obscured by interstellar matter. <s> The apparent distance between IC 10 and the Andromeda Galaxy is about the same as the apparent distance between the Andromeda Galaxy and the Triangulum Galaxy, which suggests that IC 10 may belong to the M31 subgroup. <s> IC 10 is the only known starburst galaxy in the Local Group of galaxies. <s> It has many more Wolfâ€“Rayet stars per square kiloparsec (5.1 stars/kpc) than the Large Magellanic Cloud (2.0 stars/kpc) or the Small Magellanic Cloud (0.9 stars/kpc). <s> Although the galaxy has a luminosity similar to the SMC, it is considerably smaller. <s> Its higher metallicity compared to the SMC suggests that star formation activity has continued for a longer time period. <s> The evolutionary status of the Wolfâ€“Rayet stars suggests that they all formed in a relatively short timespan. <s> The ratio between the two types of Wolfâ€“Rayet stars (WC stars and WN stars) in IC 10 is very different from the ratio in other galaxies in the Local Group, which may be somehow due to the starburst nature of the galaxy. <s> Currently, the galaxy produces stars at the rate of 0.04â€“0.08 solar masses per year, which means that the gas supply in the galaxy can last for only a few billion years longer. <s> Observations of IC 10 in the far-infrared show that the dust in this mild starburst galaxy is deficient in small grains. <s> It is hypothesized that any small grains that formerly existed were destroyed by strong ultraviolet radiation in the areas around the hot luminous stars that were formed in the galaxy's recent burst of star formation. <s> The galaxy has a huge envelope of hydrogen gas, with an apparent size measuring 68â€² Ã— 80â€², which is far larger than the apparent size of the galaxy in visible light (5.5â€² Ã— 7.0â€²). <s> IC 10 is also unusual in the respect that the visible part of the galaxy seems to rotate in a different direction than the outer envelope. <s> It has a H II nucleus.
John Forrest Dillon (December 25, 1831 â€“ May 6, 1914) was an attorney in Iowa and New York, a Justice of the Iowa Supreme Court and a United States Circuit Judge of the United States Circuit Courts for the Eighth Circuit. <s> He authored a highly influential treatise on the power of states over municipal governments. <s> Born on December 25, 1831, in Northampton, (then part of Montgomery County, now part of Fulton County), New York, Dillon received a Doctor of Medicine in 1850 from the University of Iowa. <s> He read law in 1852. <s> He entered private practice in Davenport, Iowa from 1852 to 1853. <s> He was county attorney for Scott County, Iowa from 1853 to 1858. <s> He was a Judge of the Iowa District Court for the Seventh Judicial District from 1858 to 1862. <s> He was a Justice of the Iowa Supreme Court from 1862 to 1868. <s> While on the federal bench, Dillon wrote "Municipal Corporations" (1872), one of the earliest systematic studies of the subject. <s> He also authored "Removal of Cases from State Courts to Federal Courts" and "Municipal Bonds", both in 1876. <s> On February 17, 1876, during the Whiskey Ring graft prosecutions, Justice Dillon ruled Ulysses S. Grant's deposition for Orville E. Babcock was admissible in court. <s> Following his resignation from the federal bench, Dillon was a Professor of law for Columbia University from 1879 to 1882. <s> He resumed private practice in New York City, New York from 1882 to 1914. <s> He was the Storrs Professor of law at Yale University from 1891 to 1892. <s> He died on May 6, 1914, in New York City. <s> A memorial fountain to Dillon was erected in downtown Davenport in 1918, carved of Indiana limestone in Romanesque style, by sculptor Harry Liva. <s> In 1853, Dillon married Anna Margery Price (born 19 June 1835). <s> They had two sons and a daughter. <s> Anna and their daughter, Mrs. Annie Dillon Oliver, died in the sinking of the French ocean liner SS "La Bourgogne" in July, 1898. <s> Dillon's oldest son, Hiram Price Dillon (1855â€“1918), became a lawyer in Iowa and a Master of Chancery in federal court. <s> John F. Dillon's sister married John B. Jordan, a Davenport merchant. <s> That marriage produced a daughter Jennie, who married Louis Stengel. <s> Louis and Jennie Stengel had a son, Charles Dillon (Casey) Stengel, named after the Judge, who had a long career as a baseball player and manager. <s> The theory of state preeminence over local governments was expressed as Dillon's Rule in an 1868 case: "Municipal corporations owe their origin to, and derive their powers and rights wholly from, the legislature. <s> It breathes into them the breath of life, without which they cannot exist. <s> As it creates, so may it destroy. <s> If it may destroy, it may abridge and control". <s> By contrast, the Cooley Doctrine, or the doctrine of home rule, expressed the theory of an inherent right to local self-determination. <s> In a concurring opinion, Michigan Supreme Court Judge Thomas M. Cooley in 1871 stated, "local government is a matter of absolute right; and the state cannot take it away". <s> In "Municipal Corporations" (1872), Dillon explained that in contrast to the powers of states, which are unlimited but for express restrictions under the state or federal constitution, municipalities only have the powers that are expressly granted to them. <s> This formulation of the scope of municipal power came to be known as "Dillon's Rule." <s> It holds that municipal governments have only the powers expressly granted to them by the state legislature, those powers necessarily implied by the express powers, and those that are essential and indispensable to the municipality's existence and functioning. <s> Further, the powers expressly granted to the municipality should be narrowly construed, and any ambiguities in the legislative grant of power should be resolved against the municipality. <s> However, when the state has not specifically directed the method by which the municipality may implement its granted power, the municipality has the discretion to choose the method so long as its choice is reasonable. <s> The Supreme Court of the United States cited "Municipal Corporations" and fully adopted Dillon's emphasis on state power over municipalities in "Hunter v. Pittsburgh", which upheld the power of Pennsylvania to consolidate the city of Allegheny into the city of Pittsburgh, despite the objections of a majority of Allegheny's residents. <s> The Court's ruling that states could alter or abolish at will the charters of municipal corporations without infringing upon contract rights relied upon Dillon's distinction between public, municipal corporations and private ones. <s> However, the Court did not prevent states from passing legislation or amending their constitutions to explicitly allow home rule. <s> This constitutional allowance was reiterated in "Trenton v. New Jersey", where the Supreme Court held that "In the absence of state constitutional provisions safeguarding it to them, municipalities have no inherent right of self-government which is beyond the legislative control of the state, but are merely departments of the state, with powers and privileges such as the state has seen fit to grant, held and exercised subject to its sovereign willâ€. <s> Hundreds of United States court decisions have employed the Dillon Rule to determine the scope of municipal powers and rights. <s> Critics of the rule have argued that it imposes unreasonable constraints on the ability of communities to govern themselves and undermines democracy or that local self-government is a matter of natural right that does not need to be conferred by higher political structures. <s> Some have suggested that Dillon's approach derived from the contemporary view that cities were inherently corrupt political organs. <s> States which do not follow Dillon's Ruleâ€”"home rule" states, including Dillon's own Iowaâ€”remain in the minority, despite the significant decrease in the public perception of municipal corruption.

In statistics, a confidence interval (CI) is a type of interval estimate, computed from the statistics of the observed data, that might contain the true value of an unknown population parameter. <s> The interval has an associated confidence level, or coverage that, loosely speaking, quantifies the level of confidence that the deterministic parameter is captured by the interval. <s> More strictly speaking, the confidence level represents the frequency (i.e. the proportion) of possible confidence intervals that contain the true value of the unknown population parameter. <s> In other words, if confidence intervals are constructed using a given confidence level from an infinite number of independent sample statistics, the proportion of those intervals that contain the true value of the parameter will be equal to the confidence level. <s> Confidence intervals consist of a range of potential values of the unknown population parameter. <s> However, the interval computed from a particular sample does not necessarily include the true value of the parameter. <s> Based on the (usually taken) assumption that observed data are random samples from a true population, the confidence interval obtained from the data is also random. <s> The confidence level is designated prior to examining the data. <s> Most commonly, the 95% confidence level is used. <s> However, other confidence levels can be used, for example, 90% and 99%. <s> Factors affecting the width of the confidence interval include the size of the sample, the confidence level, and the variability in the sample. <s> A larger sample will tend to produce a better estimate of the population parameter, when all other factors are equal. <s> A higher confidence level will tend to produce a broader confidence interval. <s> A machine fills cups with a liquid, and is supposed to be adjusted so that the content of the cups is 250 g of liquid. <s> As the machine cannot fill every cup with exactly 250.0 g, the content added to individual cups shows some variation, and is considered a random variable X. <s> This variation is assumed to be normally distributed around the desired average of 250 g, with a standard deviation, Ïƒ, of 2.5 g. To determine if the machine is adequately calibrated, a sample of "n" = 25 cups of liquid is chosen at random and the cups are weighed. <s> The resulting measured masses of liquid are "X", ..., "X", a random sample from "X". <s> To get an impression of the expectation "Î¼", it is sufficient to give an estimate. <s> If we take another sample of 25 cups, we could easily expect to find mean values like 250.4 or 251.1 grams. <s> A sample mean value of 280 grams however would be extremely rare if the mean content of the cups is in fact close to 250 grams. <s> There is a whole interval around the observed value 250.2 grams of the sample mean within which, if the whole population mean actually takes a value in this range, the observed data would not be considered particularly unusual. <s> Such an interval is called a confidence interval for the parameter "Î¼". <s> How do we calculate such an interval? <s> The endpoints of the interval have to be calculated from the sample, so they are statistics, functions of the sample "X", ..., "X" and hence random variables themselves. <s> dependent on the parameter "Î¼" to be estimated, but with a standard normal distribution independent of the parameter "Î¼". <s> Hence it is possible to find numbers âˆ’"z" and "z", independent of "Î¼", between which "Z" lies with probability 1 âˆ’ Î±, a measure of how confident we want to be. <s> We take 1 âˆ’ Î± = 0.95, for example. <s> This might be interpreted as: with probability 0.95 we will find a confidence interval in which the value of parameter "Î¼" will be between the stochastic endpoints <s> This does not mean there is 0.95 probability that the value of parameter "Î¼" is in the interval obtained by using the currently computed value of the sample mean, <s> Instead, every time the measurements are repeated, there will be another value for the mean of the sample. <s> In 95% of the cases "Î¼" will be between the endpoints calculated from this mean, but in 5% of the cases it will not be. <s> The actual confidence interval is calculated by entering the measured masses in the formula. <s> As the desired value 250 of "Î¼" is within the resulted confidence interval, there is no reason to believe the machine is wrongly calibrated. <s> The calculated interval has fixed endpoints, where Î¼ might be in between (or not). <s> Thus this event has probability either 0 or 1. <s> One cannot say: "with probability (1 âˆ’ "Î±") the parameter "Î¼" lies in the confidence interval." <s> One only knows that by repetition in 100(1 âˆ’ "Î±")% of the cases, "Î¼" will be in the calculated interval. <s> In 100Î±% of the cases however it does not. <s> And unfortunately one does not know in which of the cases this happens. <s> That is (instead of using the term "probability") why one can say: "with confidence level 100(1 âˆ’ Î±) %, "Î¼" lies in the confidence interval." <s> The figure on the right shows 50 realizations of a confidence interval for a given population mean "Î¼". <s> If we randomly choose one realization, the probability is 95% we end up having chosen an interval that contains the parameter; however, we may be unlucky and have picked the wrong one. <s> We will never know; we are stuck with our interval.

ErdeljanovicÌ), the northern border of SÌŒumadija lay between Avala and Kosmaj mountain. <s> According to that view, the capital of Serbia, Belgrade does not belong to this region. <s> During the 18th century, the forests and hills of SÌŒumadija were the refuge for the hajduk bands (brigands, rebels, guerilla fighters) that fought against Ottoman occupation. <s> Parts of the Sanjak of Smederevo, all of SÌŒumadija, were liberated by the Austrian army in 1718, resulting in the establishment of the Kingdom of Serbia (1718â€“39). <s> After the Austro-Russianâ€“Turkish War (1735â€“39), the sanjak was re-established. <s> In 1788, the Habsburg-organized Serbian Free Corps liberated SÌŒumadija, which, after subsequent Austrian military involvement, came together with the rest of the sanjak under Habsburg occupation (1788â€“92). <s> The First Serbian Uprising, which broke out in 1804, saw the region liberated under self-organized Serbian rebels led by SÌŒumadijan-born KaraÄ‘orÄ‘e, the national hero of Serbia. <s> The Second Serbian Uprising in 1815 was led by MilosÌŒ ObrenovicÌ who successfully repelled Ottoman forces and, by 1830, gained full autonomy for Serbia, leading to the independence of central Serbia after several centuries under Ottoman rule. <s> Between 1922 and 1929, one of the administrative units in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was the SÌŒumadijska Oblast. <s> It roughly included territory of present-day SÌŒumadija District with its administrative seat in Kragujevac, which is the seat of the modern district as well.

An undulator is an insertion device from high-energy physics and usually part of a larger installation, a synchrotron storage ring, or it may be a component of a free electron laser. <s> It consists of a periodic structure of dipole magnets. <s> These can be permanent magnets or superconducting magnets. <s> The static magnetic field alternates along the length of the undulator with a wavelength formula_1. <s> Electrons traversing the periodic magnet structure are forced to undergo oscillations and thus to radiate energy. <s> The radiation produced in an undulator is very intense and concentrated in narrow energy bands in the spectrum. <s> It is also collimated on the orbit plane of the electrons. <s> This radiation is guided through beamlines for experiments in various scientific areas. <s> where "e" is the electron charge, "B" is the magnetic field, "formula_1" is the spatial period of the undulator magnets, "formula_4" is the electron rest mass, and "c" is the speed of light. <s> This parameter characterizes the nature of the electron motion. <s> For formula_5 the oscillation amplitude of the motion is small and the radiation displays interference patterns which lead to narrow energy bands. <s> If formula_6 the oscillation amplitude is bigger and the radiation contributions from each field period sum up independently, leading to a broad energy spectrum. <s> In this regime of fields the device is no longer called an "undulator"; it is called a wiggler. <s> The usual description of the undulator is relativistic but classical. <s> This means that although a precise calculation is tedious, the undulator can be seen as a black box, where only functions inside the device affect how an input is converted to an output; an electron enters the box and an electromagnetic pulse exits through a small exit slit. <s> The slit should be small enough such that only the main cone passes, and the side lobes of the wavelength spectra can be ignored. <s> Undulators can provide several orders of magnitude higher flux than a simple bending magnet and as such are in high demand at synchrotron radiation facilities. <s> For an undulator with N periods, the brightness can be up to formula_7 more than a bending magnet. <s> The first factor of N occurs because the intensity is enhanced up to a factor of N at harmonic wavelengths due to the constructive interference of the fields emitted during the N radiation periods. <s> The usual pulse is a sine with some envelope. <s> The second factor of N comes from the reduction of the emission angle associated with these harmonics, which is reduced as 1/N. <s> When the electrons come with half the period, they interfere destructively, the undulator stays dark. <s> The same is true, if they come as a bead chain. <s> The polarization of the emitted radiation can be controlled by using permanent magnets to induce different periodic electron trajectories through the undulator. <s> If the oscillations are confined to a plane the radiation will be linearly polarized. <s> If the oscillation trajectory is helical, the radiation will be circularly polarized, with the handedness determined by the helix. <s> If the electrons follow the Poisson distribution a partial interference leads to a linear increase in intensity. <s> In the free electron laser the intensity increases exponentially with the number of electrons. <s> An undulator's figure of merit is spectral radiance. <s> The Russian physicist Vitaly Ginzburg showed theoretically that undulators could be built in a 1947 paper. <s> Julian Schwinger published a useful paper in 1949 that reduced the necessary calculations to Bessel functions, for which there were tables. <s> This was significant for solving the design equations as digital computers were not available to most academics at that time. <s> Hans Motz and his coworkers at Stanford University demonstrated the first undulator in 1952. <s> It produced the first manmade coherent infrared radiation. <s> The design could produce a total frequency range from visible light down to millimeter waves.

Conservation biology is the management of nature and of Earth's biodiversity with the aim of protecting species, their habitats, and ecosystems from excessive rates of extinction and the erosion of biotic interactions. <s> It is an interdisciplinary subject drawing on natural and social sciences, and the practice of natural resource management. <s> The term conservation biology and its conception as a new field originated with the convening of "The First International Conference on Research in Conservation Biology" held at the University of California, San Diego in La Jolla, California in 1978 led by American biologists Bruce A. Wilcox and Michael E. SouleÌ with a group of leading university and zoo researchers and conservationists including Kurt Benirschke, Sir Otto Frankel, Thomas Lovejoy, and Jared Diamond. <s> The meeting was prompted by the concern over tropical deforestation, disappearing species, eroding genetic diversity within species. <s> The conference and proceedings that resulted sought to initiate the bridging of a gap between theory in ecology and evolutionary genetics on the one hand and conservation policy and practice on the other. <s> Conservation biology and the concept of biological diversity (biodiversity) emerged together, helping crystallize the modern era of conservation science and policy. <s> The inherent multidisciplinary basis for conservation biology has led to new subdisciplines including conservation social science, conservation behavior and conservation physiology.

An arch bridge is a bridge with abutments at each end shaped as a curved arch. <s> Arch bridges work by transferring the weight of the bridge and its loads partially into a horizontal thrust restrained by the abutments at either side. <s> A viaduct (a long bridge) may be made from a series of arches, although other more economical structures are typically used today. <s> Possibly the oldest existing arch bridge is the Mycenaean Arkadiko Bridge in Greece from about 1300 BC. <s> The stone corbel arch bridge is still used by the local populace. <s> The well-preserved Hellenistic Eleutherna Bridge has a triangular corbel arch. <s> The 4th century BC Rhodes Footbridge rests on an early voussoir arch. <s> Although true arches were already known by the Etruscans and ancient Greeks, the Romans were â€“ as with the vault and the dome â€“ the first to fully realize the potential of arches for bridge construction. <s> A list of Roman bridges compiled by the engineer Colin O'Connor features 330 Roman stone bridges for traffic, 34 Roman timber bridges and 54 Roman aqueduct bridges, a substantial part still standing and even used to carry vehicles. <s> A more complete survey by the Italian scholar Vittorio Galliazzo found 931 Roman bridges, mostly of stone, in as many as 26 different countries (including former Yugoslavia). <s> Roman arch bridges were usually semicircular, although a number were segmental arch bridges (such as AlconeÌtar Bridge), a bridge which has a curved arch that is less than a semicircle. <s> The advantages of the segmental arch bridge were that it allowed great amounts of flood water to pass under it, which would prevent the bridge from being swept away during floods and the bridge itself could be more lightweight. <s> Generally, Roman bridges featured wedge-shaped primary arch stones (voussoirs) of the same in size and shape. <s> The Romans built both single spans and lengthy multiple arch aqueducts, such as the Pont du Gard and Segovia Aqueduct. <s> Their bridges featured from an early time onwards flood openings in the piers, e.g. in the Pons Fabricius in Rome (62 BC), one of the world's oldest major bridges still standing. <s> The Romans also introduced segmental arch bridges into bridge construction. <s> The 330 m Limyra Bridge in southwestern Turkey features 26 segmental arches with an average span-to-rise ratio of 5.3:1, giving the bridge an unusually flat profile unsurpassed for more than a millennium. <s> Trajan's bridge over the Danube featured open-spandrel segmental arches made of wood (standing on 40 m concrete piers). <s> This was to be the longest arch bridge for a thousand years both in terms of overall and individual span length, while the longest extant Roman bridge is the 790 m long Puente Romano at MeÌrida. <s> The late Roman Karamagara Bridge in Cappadocia may represent the earliest surviving bridge featuring a pointed arch. <s> In medieval Europe, bridge builders improved on the Roman structures by using narrower piers, thinner arch barrels and higher span to rise ratios on bridges. <s> Gothic pointed arches were also introduced, reducing lateral thrust, and spans increased as with the eccentric Puente del Diablo (1282). <s> The 14th century in particular saw bridge building reaching new heights. <s> Span lengths of 40 m , previously unheard of in the history of masonry arch construction, were now reached in places as diverse as Spain (Puente de San MartiÌn), Italy (Castelvecchio Bridge) and France (Devil's bridge and Pont Grand) and with arch types as different as semi-circular, pointed and segmental arches. <s> The bridge at Trezzo sull'Adda, destroyed in the 15th century, even featured a span length of 72 m , not matched until 1796. <s> Stone, brick and other such materials are strong in compression and somewhat so in shear, but cannot resist much force in tension. <s> As a result, masonry arch bridges are designed to be constantly under compression, so far as is possible. <s> Each arch is constructed over a temporary falsework frame, known as a centring. <s> In the first compression arch bridges, a keystone in the middle of the bridge bore the weight of the rest of the bridge. <s> The more weight that was put onto the bridge, the stronger its structure became. <s> Masonry arch bridges use a quantity of fill material (typically compacted rubble) above the arch in order to increase this dead-weight on the bridge and prevent tension from occurring in the arch ring as loads move across the bridge. <s> Other materials that were used to build this type of bridge were brick and unreinforced concrete. <s> When masonry (cut stone) is used the angles of the faces are cut to minimize shear forces. <s> Where random masonry (uncut and unprepared stones) is used they are mortared together and the mortar is allowed to set before the falsework is removed.

as well as the Maldives and Chagos Archipelago to the east. <s> With a population of roughly , it has the smallest population of any sovereign African country. <s> Seychelles is divided into twenty-six administrative regions comprising all of the inner islands. <s> Eight of the districts make up the capital of Seychelles and are referred to as Greater Victoria. <s> Another 14 districts are considered the rural part of the main island of MaheÌ with two districts on Praslin and one on La Digue which also includes respective satellite islands. <s> The rest of the Outer Islands (" ") are the last district recently created by the tourism ministry. <s> An island nation, Seychelles is located in the Indian Ocean, northeast of Madagascar and about 1600 km east of Kenya. <s> The Constitution of Seychelles lists 155 named islands and a further 7 reclaimed islands have been created subsequent to the publication of the Constitution. <s> The majority of the islands are uninhabited, with many dedicated as nature reserves. <s> Seychelles is among the world's leading countries to protect lands for threatened species, allocating 42% of its territory for conservation. <s> Like many fragile island ecosystems, Seychelles saw the loss of biodiversity when humans first settled in the area, including the disappearance of most of the giant tortoises from the granitic islands, the felling of coastal and mid-level forests, and the extinction of species such as the chestnut flanked white eye, the Seychelles parakeet, and the saltwater crocodile. <s> However, extinctions were far fewer than on islands such as Mauritius or Hawaii, partly due to a shorter period of human occupation (since 1770). <s> Seychelles today is known for success stories in protecting its flora and fauna. <s> The rare Seychelles black parrot, the national bird of the country, is now protected. <s> The granitic islands of Seychelles are home to about 75 endemic plant species, with a further 25 or so species in the Aldabra group. <s> Particularly well-known is the coco de mer, a species of palm that grows only on the islands of Praslin and neighbouring Curieuse. <s> Sometimes nicknamed the "love nut" because the shape of its "double" coconut resembles buttocks, the coco-de-mer produces the world's heaviest seed. <s> The jellyfish tree is to be found in only a few locations on Mahe. <s> This strange and ancient plant in a genus of its own ("Medusagyne") seems to reproduce only in cultivation and not in the wild. <s> Other unique plant species include Wright's gardenia ("Rothmannia annae") found only on Aride Island Special Reserve. <s> The freshwater crab genus "Seychellum" is endemic to the granitic Seychelles, and a further 26 species of crabs and five species of hermit crabs live on the islands. <s> The Aldabra giant tortoise now populates many of the islands of Seychelles; the Aldabra population is the largest remaining. <s> These unique reptiles can be found even in captive herds. <s> The granitic islands of Seychelles may support distinct species of Seychelles giant tortoises; the status of the different populations is currently unclear. <s> There are several unique species of orchid on the islands. <s> The marine life around the islands, especially the more remote coral islands, can be spectacular. <s> More than 1,000 species of fish have been recorded. <s> Since the use of spearguns and dynamite for fishing was banned through efforts of local conservationists in the 1960s, the wildlife is unafraid of snorkelers and divers. <s> Coral bleaching in 1998 has damaged most reefs, but some reefs show healthy recovery (e.g., Silhouette Island). <s> French and English are official languages along with Seychellois Creole, which is primarily based upon French. <s> However, nowadays the language is often laced with English words and phrases. <s> Including second-language speakers, Seychellois is the most-spoken official language in the Seychelles, followed by French and English. <s> 87% of the population speaks Seychelles Creole, 51% speaks French, and 38% speaks English. <s> Most business and official meetings are conducted in English and nearly all official websites are in English. <s> National Assembly business is conducted in Creole, but laws are passed and published in English. <s> During the plantation era, cinnamon, vanilla and copra were the chief exports. <s> In 1965, during a three-month visit to the islands, futurist Donald Prell prepared for the then-crown colony Governor General an economic report containing a scenario for the future of the economy. <s> Quoting from his report, in the 1960s, about 33% of the working population worked at plantations, and 20% worked in the public or government sector. <s> The Indian Ocean Tracking Station on MaheÌ used by the Air Force Satellite Control Network was closed in August 1996 after the Seychelles government attempted to raise the rent to more than $10,000,000 per year. <s> In 1971, with the opening of Seychelles International Airport, tourism became a significant industry, essentially dividing the economy into plantations and tourism. <s> The tourism sector paid better, and the plantation economy could only expand so far.

The 45-minute successful flight of Larry Walters on July 2, 1982, was in a homemade airship made of an ordinary patio chair and 45 helium-filled weather balloons. <s> The aircraft rose to an altitude of over 15000 ft and floated from the point of takeoff in San Pedro, California, into and violating controlled airspace near Los Angeles International Airport. <s> During the landing, the aircraft became entangled in power lines, but Walters was able to safely climb down. <s> The flight attracted worldwide media attention and inspired a later movie and imitators. <s> Lawrence Richard Walters (April 19, 1949 â€“ October 6, 1993) had often dreamed of flying, but was unable to become a pilot in the United States Air Force because of his poor eyesight. <s> He first thought of using weather balloons to fly at age 13, after seeing them hanging from the ceiling of a military surplus store. <s> He had a career as an American truck driver. <s> In 1982, he decided to try his flying idea. <s> His intention was to float over the Mojave Desert and then use a pellet gun to burst some of the balloons in order to land. <s> In mid-1982, Walters and his girlfriend at the time, Carol Van Deusen, purchased 45 8 ft weather balloons and obtained helium tanks from California Toy Time Balloons. <s> They used a forged requisition from his employer, FilmFair Studios, saying the balloons were for a television commercial. <s> On July 2, 1982, Walters attached 43 of the balloons to his lawn chair, filled them with helium, put on a parachute, and strapped himself into the chair in the backyard of a home at 1633 West 7th Street in San Pedro. <s> He took his pellet gun, a CB radio, sandwiches, beer, and a camera. <s> When his friends cut the cord that tied his lawn chair to his Jeep, Walters's lawn chair rose rapidly to a height of about 16000 ft and was spotted from two commercial airliners. <s> He slowly drifted over Long Beach and crossed the primary approach corridor of Long Beach Airport. <s> After 45 minutes in the sky, Walters shot several balloons, taking care not to unbalance the load. <s> He then accidentally dropped his pellet gun overboard. <s> He descended slowly, until the balloons' dangling cables got caught in a power line at 432 45th Street in Long Beach. <s> The power line broke, causing a 20-minute electricity blackout. <s> He landed unharmed on the ground. <s> Walters was immediately arrested by waiting members of the Long Beach Police Department. <s> Regional safety inspector Neal Savoy was reported to have said, "We know he broke some part of the Federal Aviation Act, and as soon as we decide which part it is, some type of charge will be filed. <s> If he had a pilot's license, we'd suspend that, but he doesn't." <s> Walters initially was fined $4,000 for violations under U.S. Federal Aviation Regulations, including operating an aircraft within an airport traffic area "without establishing and maintaining two-way communications with the control tower." <s> Walters appealed, and the fine was reduced to $1,500. <s> A charge of operating a "civil aircraft for which there is not currently in effect an airworthiness certificate" was dropped, as it was not applicable to his class of aircraft. <s> The aircraft was dubbed "Inspiration I". <s> Lawn Chair Larry was awarded the title of "At-Risk Survivor" in the 1993 Darwin Awards. <s> After his flight, Walters was briefly in demand as a motivational speaker, and quit his job as a truck driver. <s> He was featured in a Timex print ad in the early 1990s, but never made much money from his fame. <s> The lawn chair used in the flight was reportedly given to an admiring boy named Jerry, though Walters regretted doing so when the Smithsonian Institution asked him to donate it to its museum. <s> Twenty years later, Jerry sent an email to Mark Barry, a pilot who had documented Walters' story and dedicated a website to it, and identified himself. <s> The chair was still sitting in his garage, attached to some of the original tethers and water jugs used as ballast. <s> The chair was on loan to the San Diego Air and Space Museum, on exhibition through 2014. <s> Later in his life, Walters hiked the San Gabriel Mountains and did volunteer work for the United States Forest Service. <s> He later broke up with his girlfriend of 15 years and could only find work sporadically as a security guard. <s> On October 6, 1993, at the age of 44, Walters committed suicide by shooting himself in the heart in Angeles National Forest.

The Jewish Territorial Organisation, known as the ITO, was a Jewish political movement which first arose in 1903 in response to the British Uganda Offer, but which was institutionalized in 1905. <s> Its main goal was to find an alternative territory to that of the Land of Israel, which was preferred by the Zionist movement, for the creation of a Jewish homeland. <s> The organization embraced what became known as "Jewish Territorialism" also known as "Jewish Statism" (though not to be confused with the political philosophy of the same name). <s> The ITO was dissolved in 1925. <s> The Jewish Colonization Association, created in 1891 by the Baron Maurice de Hirsch, was aimed at facilitating mass emigration of Jews from the Russian Empire and other Eastern European countries, by settling them in agricultural colonies on lands purchased by the committee, particularly in North and South America (especially Argentina). <s> Before 1905 some Zionist leaders took seriously proposals for Jewish homelands in places other than the Land of Israel. <s> Theodor Herzl hoped for a Jewish homeland in the Land of Israel but recognized that global events demanded an immediate solution to the Jewish problem, in Russia at least, even if that solution required Jewish refugees to settle outside of Eretz Israel. <s> Theodor Herzl's "Der Judenstaat" argued for a Jewish state in either Palestine, "our ever-memorable historic home", or Argentina, "one of the most fertile countries in the world". <s> Many of the socialist Zionist groups were more territorialist than Zionist, such as Nachman Syrkin's Zionist Socialist Workers Party (the Z.S.). <s> In 1903 British cabinet ministers suggested the British Uganda Program, land for a Jewish state in "Uganda" (actually in modern Kenya). <s> Herzl initially rejected the idea, preferring Palestine, but after the April 1903 Kishinev pogrom Herzl introduced a controversial proposal to the Sixth Zionist Congress to investigate the offer as a temporary measure for Russian Jews in danger. <s> Notwithstanding its emergency and temporary nature, the proposal still proved very divisive, and widespread opposition to the plan was demonstrated by a walkout led by the Russian Jewish delegation to the Congress. <s> Few historians believe that such a settlement scheme could have attracted immigrants, Jewish financial support, or international political support. <s> Since there was strong support on the part of some members of the Zionist leadership, however, peace was kept in the movement by the time-honored parliamentary maneuver of voting to establish a committee for the investigation of the possibility, which was not finally dismissed until the 7th Zionist Congress in 1905. <s> The Jewish Territorial Organization (ITO) was founded by British Jewish author, critic, and activist Israel Zangwill and British Jewish journalist Lucien Wolf in 1903 and institutionalized in 1905. <s> The establishment was a response to Herzl's rejection of Uganda proposal, as the ITO led by Zangwill split off from the Zionist movement. <s> It attempted to locate territory suitable for Jewish settlement in various parts of America (e.g. Galveston), and on the African, Asian, and Australian continents, yet with little success. <s> In 1905 the members of the Seventh Zionist Congress formally rejected the Uganda Scheme. <s> Following the rejection of the East Africa offer, Zangwill contacted Lucien Wolf, an English Jewish journalist and member of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, the main representative body of Anglo Jewry. <s> Wolf was an opponent of political Zionism, but did support the creation of Jewish colonies in the Diaspora. <s> In August 1905 Zangwill and Wolf met to discuss the Uganda Scheme, and in subsequent correspondence between the two we learn that both supported the creation of a Jewish colony in British East Africa. <s> Wolf had objected to any specifically "Jewish national homeland", that is to say a state which ghettoized Jews, preserving Jewish customs and law as the basis for governance. <s> Though Zangwill's literary works suggest his nostalgia for the ghetto, he too recognized the need for a modern Jewish polity. <s> Both concurred that a self-governing Jewish territory should be based on a preponderance of Jews in the region rather than British legislative fiat, and both concurred that the new government should be formed on a modern, democratic basis rather than some earlier biblical ideal or Eastern European Kehilla structure. <s> This basic agreement between Zangwill and Wolf would lead to the formation of the Jewish Territorial Organisation (ITO), an organisation dedicated to "obtaining a large tract of territory (preferably within the British Empire) wherein to found a Jewish Home of Refuge", and to the elevation of Zangwill to the ITO presidency. <s> After the October Revolution there was in the USSR a Territorialist effort in Ukraine, the Crimea and then in a region surrounding Birobidzhan, where a Jewish Autonomous Region was established in 1934. <s> (The Jewish Autonomous Oblast (JAO) ( , "Yevreyskaya avtonomnaya oblast"; ) is still today an autonomous oblast situated in Russia's far east.) <s> In the United States, the Organization for Jewish Colonization in Russia worked to encourage the emigration and settlement of Jews there. <s> In the face of the looming Nazi genocide, Isaac Nachman Steinberg established the Freeland League for Jewish Territorial Colonization in the United States in 1935. <s> This organization attempted, unsuccessfully, to pursue Jewish autonomy by obtaining a large piece of territory in sparsely populated areas in Ecuador, Australia, or Surinam. <s> One of the more well-known ventures was the Kimberley Plan, to secure land in Australia. <s> The Kimberley Plan was officially vetoed on 15 July 1944 by Australian Prime Minister, John Curtin, who informed Steinberg that the Australian government would not "depart from the long-established policy in regard to alien settlement in Australia" and could not "entertain the proposal for a group settlement of the exclusive type contemplated by the Freeland League". <s> After the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, Steinberg criticized the exclusivist politics of the Israeli government and continued his attempts to create a non-nationalist Jewish settlement in some other region of the world. <s> After Steinberg's death in 1957 the Freeland League was led by Mordkhe Schaechter, who gradually changed the focus of the organization to more cultural, Yiddishist goals.

In the United Kingdom, an ancient woodland is a woodland that has existed continuously since 1600 or before in England, Wales and Northern Ireland (or 1750 in Scotland). <s> Planting of woodland was uncommon before those dates, so a wood present in 1600 is likely to have developed naturally. <s> For many species of animal and plant, ancient woodland sites provide the sole habitat, and for many others, conditions on these sites are much more suitable than those on other sites. <s> Ancient woodland in the UK, like rainforest in the tropics, is home to rare and threatened species. <s> For these reasons ancient woodland is often described as an irreplaceable resource, or 'critical natural capital'. <s> The analogous term used in the United States is "Old-growth forest". <s> Ancient woodland is formally defined on maps by Natural England and equivalent bodies. <s> Mapping of ancient woodland has been undertaken in different ways and at different times, and the quality and availability of data varies from region to region, although there are some efforts to standardise and update it. <s> Many ancient woodlands have legal protection of various types, but it is not automatically the case that any ancient woodland is protected. <s> Some examples of ancient woodland are nationally or locally designated, for example as Sites of Special Scientific Interest.

The Peak District is an upland area in England at the southern end of the Pennines. <s> It is mostly in northern Derbyshire, but also includes parts of Cheshire, Greater Manchester, Staffordshire, West Yorkshire and South Yorkshire. <s> An area of great diversity, it is mostly split into the Dark Peak, where most of the moorland is found and the geology is gritstone, and the limestone area of the White Peak. <s> The Peak District National Park became the first national park in the United Kingdom in 1951. <s> With its proximity to the cities of Manchester, Stoke-on-Trent, Derby and Sheffield, and access by road and rail, it attracts millions of visitors every year. <s> The Peak District is at the southern end of the Pennines and much of the area is upland above 1000 ft . <s> Its high point is Kinder Scout at 2087 ft . <s> Despite its name, the landscape generally lacks sharp peaks, and is characterised mostly by rounded hills, plateaus, valleys, limestone gorges and gritstone escarpments (the "edges"). <s> The area, mostly rural, is surrounded by conurbations and large urban areas including Manchester, Huddersfield, Sheffield, Derby and Stoke-on-Trent. <s> The Peak is formed almost exclusively from sedimentary rocks dating from the Carboniferous period. <s> They comprise the Carboniferous Limestone, overlying Gritstone and the Coal Measures which occur only on the extreme margins and infrequent outcrops of igneous rocks including lavas, tuffs and volcanic vent agglomerates. <s> The general geological structure is that of a broad dome, whose western margins have been most intensely faulted and folded. <s> Uplift and erosion have effectively sliced the top off the dome to reveal a concentric outcrop pattern with Coal Measures rocks on the eastern and western margins, Carboniferous Limestone at the core and with rocks of Millstone Grit outcropping between them. <s> The southern edge of the dome is overlain by sandstones of Triassic age though they barely impinge on the National Park. <s> The White Peak is the central and southern section where Carboniferous Limestone is found at or near the surface. <s> The Dark Peak to the north, east and west is characterised by Millstone Grit outcrops and broad swathes of moorland. <s> Earth movements after the Carboniferous period resulted in the up-doming of the area and, particularly in the west, the folding of the rock strata along northâ€“south axes. <s> The region was raised in a northâ€“south line which resulted in the dome-like shape and the shales and sandstones were worn away until limestone was exposed. <s> At the end of this period, the Earth's crust sank here which led to the area being covered by sea, depositing a variety of new rocks. <s> Some time after its deposition, mineral veins were formed in the limestone. <s> The veins and rakes have been mined for lead since Roman times. <s> The Peak District was covered by ice during at least one of the ice ages of the last 2 million years (probably the Anglian glaciation of around 450,000 years ago) as evidenced by the patches of glacial till or boulder clay that can be found across the area. <s> It was not covered by ice during the last glacial period, which peaked around 20,000â€“22,000 years ago. <s> A mix of Irish Sea and Lake District ice abutted against its western margins. <s> Glacial meltwaters eroded a complex of sinuous channels along this margin of the district during this period. <s> Glacial meltwaters contributed to the formation and development of many caves in the limestone area. <s> Wild animal herds roamed the area, and their remains have been found in several of the local caves. <s> The different types of rock beneath the soil strongly influence the landscape; they determine the type of vegetation that will grow, and ultimately the type of animal that will inhabit the area. <s> Limestone has fissures and is soluble in water, therefore rivers have been able to carve deep, narrow valleys. <s> The rivers then often find routes underground, creating cave systems. <s> Millstone Grit is insoluble but porous, absorbing water which seeps through the grits, until it meets the less porous shales beneath, creating springs where it reaches the surface. <s> The shales are friable and easily attacked by frost and form areas that are vulnerable to landslides, as on Mam Tor.

The Kippax was one of the best known and vocally active terraced stands at Manchester City's Maine Road ground. <s> Originally the Popular Side when the stadium opened in 1923, its name was changed in 1956 when the club gained planning permission to build a roof to shield fans from the rain. <s> It was named after Kippax Street which ran along this side of the ground. <s> The Kippax was unusual in that, unlike at most other grounds, it occupied a full side rather than an end of the ground as with goal end terraces like Liverpool's Kop, Manchester United's Stretford End, Everton's Gwladys Street, Newcastle United's Gallowgate or Aston Villa's Holte End. <s> In the summer of 1994, due to the Taylor Report, the Kippax was demolished. <s> A new all seater stand was built in its place and opened by City legend Bert Trautmann in October 1995. <s> It housed 10,178 seated fans, had three tiers and was at the time the highest stand in the country. <s> The club left Maine Road in May 2003 and relocated to the City of Manchester Stadium. <s> The old stadium was demolished in early 2004. <s> Unofficially, the East Stand at the new stadium is also called The Kippax.

In legal terminology, a complaint is any formal legal document that sets out the facts and legal reasons (see: cause of action) that the filing party or parties (the plaintiff(s)) believes are sufficient to support a claim against the party or parties against whom the claim is brought (the defendant(s)) that entitles the plaintiff(s) to a remedy (either money damages or injunctive relief). <s> For example, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP) that govern civil litigation in United States courts provide that a civil action is commenced with the filing or service of a pleading called a complaint. <s> Civil court rules in states that have incorporated the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure use the same term for the same pleading. <s> In some jurisdictions, specific types of criminal cases may also be commenced by the filing of a complaint, also sometimes called a criminal complaint or felony complaint. <s> Most criminal cases are prosecuted in the name of the governmental authority that promulgates criminal statutes and enforces the police power of the state with the goal of seeking criminal sanctions, such as the State (also sometimes called the People) or Crown (in Commonwealth realms). <s> In the United States, the complaint is often associated with misdemeanor criminal charges presented by the prosecutor without the grand jury process. <s> In most U.S. jurisdictions, the charging instrument presented to and authorized by a grand jury is referred to as an indictment. <s> For example, in United States federal courts, any person who is at least 18 years old and not a party may serve a summons and complaint in a civil case. <s> The defendant must submit an answer within 21 days after being served with the summons and complaint, or request a waiver, according to FRCP Rule 12. <s> After the civil complaint has been served to the defendants, the plaintiff must, as soon as practicable initiate a conference between the parties to plan for the rest of the discovery process and then the parties should submit a proposed discovery plan to the judge within 14 days after the conference.

The systole is the part of the cardiac cycle during which some chambers of the heart muscle contract after refilling with blood. <s> The term "systole" originates from New Latin via Ancient Greek ÏƒÏ…ÏƒÏ„Î¿Î»Î·Ì (sustoleÌ„): from ÏƒÏ…ÏƒÏ„ÎµÌÎ»Î»ÎµÎ¹Î½ (sustellein, "to contract") via [ÏƒÏ…ÌÎ½ (syn, "together") + ÏƒÏ„ÎµÌÎ»Î»ÎµÎ¹Î½ (stellein, "send"). <s> The use of systole, "to contract", is very similar to the use of the English term "to squeeze". <s> When, in late ventricular diastole, the atrial chambers contract, they send blood down to the larger, lower ventricle chambers. <s> When normal flow is completed, the ventricles are filled and the valves to the atria are closed. <s> The ventricles now perform systole isovolumetrically, which is contraction while all valves are closedâ€”ending the first stage of systole. <s> The second stage proceeds immediately, pumping oxygenated blood from the left ventricle through the aortic valve and aorta to all body systems, and simultaneously pumping oxygen-poor blood from the right ventricle through the pulmonic valve and pulmonary artery to the lungs. <s> Thus, the pairs of chambers (upper atria and lower ventricles) contract in alternating sequence to each other. <s> First, atrial contraction feeds blood into the ventricles, then ventricular contraction pumps blood out of the heart to the body systems, including the lungs for resupply of oxygen. <s> When blood pressure is stated for medical purposes, it is usually written with the systolic and diastolic pressures separated by a slash, for example, 120/80 mmHg. <s> This clinical notation is not a mathematical figure for a fraction or ratio, nor a display of a numerator over a denominator.

The Declaration of Arbroath ( ; ; ) is a declaration of Scottish independence, made in 1320. <s> It is in the form of a letter in Latin submitted to Pope John XXII, dated 6 April 1320, intended to confirm Scotland's status as an independent, sovereign state and defending Scotland's right to use military action when unjustly attacked. <s> Generally believed to have been written in the Arbroath Abbey by Bernard of Kilwinning, then Chancellor of Scotland and Abbot of Arbroath, and sealed by fifty-one magnates and nobles, the letter is the sole survivor of three created at the time. <s> The others were a letter from the King of Scots, Robert I, and a letter from four Scottish bishops which all made similar points. <s> The Declaration was part of a broader diplomatic campaign which sought to assert Scotland's position as an independent kingdom, rather than being a feudal land controlled by England's Norman kings, as well as lift the excommunication of Robert the Bruce. <s> The pope had recognised Edward I of England's claim to overlordship of Scotland in 1305 and Bruce was excommunicated by the Pope for murdering John Comyn before the altar in Greyfriars Church in Dumfries in 1306. <s> There are 39 namesâ€”eight earls and thirty one baronsâ€”at the start of the document, all of whom may have had their seals appended, probably over the space of some weeks and months, with nobles sending in their seals to be used. <s> On the extant copy of the Declaration there are only 19 seals, and of those 19 people only 12 are named within the document. <s> It is thought likely that at least 11 more seals than the original 39 might have been appended. <s> The Declaration was then taken to the papal court at Avignon by Bishop Kininmund, Sir Adam Gordon and Sir Odard de Maubuisson. <s> The Pope heeded the arguments contained in the Declaration, influenced by the offer of support from the Scots for his long-desired crusade if they no longer had to fear English invasion. <s> He exhorted Edward II in a letter to make peace with the Scots, but the following year was again persuaded by the English to take their side and issued six bulls to that effect. <s> On 1 March 1328 the new English king, Edward III signed a peace treaty between Scotland and England, the Treaty of Edinburgh-Northampton. <s> In this treaty, which was in effect for five years until 1333, Edward renounced all English claims to Scotland. <s> Eight months later, in October 1328, the interdict on Scotland, and the excommunication of its king, were removed by the Pope. <s> US Senate Resolution 155 of 10 November 1997 states that the Declaration of Arbroath, the Scottish Declaration of Independence sic, was signed on 6 April 1320 and the American Declaration of Independence was modelled on that inspirational document. <s> However, although this influence is accepted by some historians, it is disputed by others.

Thirunallar is a small town in Karaikal, India, in the Union Territory of Puducherry, and can be reached by road from the town of Karaikal, an enclave which lies within the neighbouring state of Tamil Nadu. <s> Thirunallar is most noted for the shrine of Lord Sani (Saturn), Tirunallar Saniswaran Temple within the temple dedicated to Lord Darbharanyeswaran, a form of Lord Shiva. <s> This is the only temple that is dedicated to Lord Shani (Saneeswaran, in Tamil). <s> Whenever (planet) Saturn transits from one zodiac sign to another (an occurrence roughly every 2.5 years), millions throng this shrine for worship. <s> The legendary King Nala is said to have been relieved of his afflictions caused by the malefic influence of Saturn, after worship in this temple. <s> Of the numerous theertams (sacred bathing places), the Nala theertam is the most important one. <s> It is believed that by bathing here, one washes off all kinds of misfortunes and afflictions caused by one's past of karmas (in terms of deities, Lord Shani or Saturn is said to be the dispenser of karmas (both good and bad), but also one whose Grace, particularly at this shrine, can dispel bad karmas or, at least, make them bearable) <s> The name ThiruNallar(u) is believed to represent the association of King Nala of the Nishadha country who was delivered from the bad effects of Shani (Saturn) by invoking the Lord's mercy here (Nala + Aru = Nallaru). <s> The word "Aru" here denotes "to heal" and the two words taken together means the place where Nala was redeemed from the (malefic) hold of Saturn through the Lord's Grace.
The Statute of Westminster 1931 is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom whose modified versions are now domestic law within Australia and Canada; it has been repealed in New Zealand and implicitly in former Dominions that are no longer Commonwealth realms. <s> Passed on 11 December 1931, the act, either immediately or upon ratification, effectively both established the legislative independence of the self-governing Dominions of the British Empire from the United Kingdom and bound them all to seek each other's approval for changes to monarchical titles and the common line of succession. <s> It thus became a statutory embodiment of the principles of equality and common allegiance to the Crown set out in the Balfour Declaration of 1926. <s> As the statute removed nearly all of the British parliament's authority to legislate for the Dominions, it had the effect of making the Dominions largely sovereign nations in their own right. <s> It was a crucial step in the development of the Dominions as separate states. <s> The Statute of Westminster's relevance today is that it sets the basis for the continuing relationship between the Commonwealth realms and the Crown.

The wrasses are a family, Labridae, of marine fish, many of which are brightly colored. <s> The family is large and diverse, with over 600 species in 81 genera, which are divided into 9 subgroups or tribes. <s> They are typically small fish, most of them less than 20 cm long, although the largest, the humphead wrasse, can measure up to 2.5 m . <s> They are efficient carnivores, feeding on a wide range of small invertebrates. <s> Many smaller wrasses follow the feeding trails of larger fish, picking up invertebrates disturbed by their passing. <s> Juveniles of some representatives of the genera "Bodianus", "Epibulus", "Cirrhilabrus", "Oxycheilinus", and "Paracheilinus" hide among the tentacles of the free-living mushroom coral "Heliofungia actiniformis". <s> The word "wrasse" comes from the Cornish word "wragh", a lenited form of "gwragh", meaning an old woman or hag, via Cornish dialect "wrath". <s> It is related to the Welsh "gwrach" and Breton "gwrac'h". <s> Wrasses have protractile mouths, usually with separate jaw teeth that jut outwards. <s> Many species can be readily recognized by their thick lips, the inside of which is sometimes curiously folded, a peculiarity which gave rise the German name of "lip-fishes" ("Lippfische".) <s> and the Dutch name of "lipvissen". <s> The dorsal fin has eight to 21 spines and six to 21 soft rays, usually running most of the length of the back. <s> Wrasse are sexually dimorphic. <s> Many species are capable of changing sex. <s> Juveniles are a mix of males and females (known as initial-phase individuals), but the largest adults become territory-holding (terminal phase) males.

Grimms' Fairy Tales, originally known as the Children's and Household Tales ( , ] ), is a collection of fairy tales by the Grimm brothers or "Brothers Grimm", Jakob and Wilhelm, first published on 20 December 1812. <s> The first edition contained 86 stories, and by the seventh edition in 1857, had 211 unique fairy tales. <s> The first volume of the first edition was published in 1812, containing 86 stories; the second volume of 70 stories followed in 1815. <s> For the second edition, two volumes were issued in 1819 and a third in 1822, totaling 170 tales. <s> The third edition appeared in 1837; fourth edition, 1840; fifth edition, 1843; sixth edition, 1850; seventh edition, 1857. <s> Stories were added, and also subtracted, from one edition to the next, until the seventh held 211 tales. <s> All editions were extensively illustrated, first by Philipp Grot Johann and, after his death in 1892, by German illustrator Robert Leinweber. <s> The first volumes were much criticized because, although they were called "Children's Tales", they were not regarded as suitable for children, both for the scholarly information included and the subject matter. <s> Many changes through the editions â€“ such as turning the wicked mother of the first edition in "Snow White" and "Hansel and Gretel" (shown in original Grimm stories as HaÌˆnsel and Grethel) to a stepmother, were probably made with an eye to such suitability. <s> Jack Zipes believes that the Grimms made the change in later editions because they â€œheld motherhood sacredâ€. <s> They removed sexual referencesâ€”such as Rapunzel's innocently asking why her dress was getting tight around her belly, and thus naively revealing to the witch Dame Gothel her pregnancy and the prince's visitsâ€”but, in many respects, violence, particularly when punishing villains, was increased. <s> The brothers' initial intention of their first book, Childrenâ€™s and Household Tales, was to establish a name for themselves in the world. <s> After the first book was published in 1812, they began their second volume, "German Legends," which was published in 1818. <s> The book that started their international success was not any of their tales, but Jacobâ€™s publication of "German Grammar" in 1819. <s> This was one year after their publication of the "German Legends". <s> In 1825, the Brothers published their "Kleine Ausgabe" or "small edition", a selection of 50 tales designed for child readers. <s> This children's version went through ten editions between 1825 and 1858. <s> The Grimms believed that the most natural and pure forms of culture were linguistic and based in history. <s> The work of the Brothers Grimm influenced other collectors, both inspiring them to collect tales and leading them to similarly believe, in a spirit of romantic nationalism, that the fairy tales of a country were particularly representative of it, to the neglect of cross-cultural influence. <s> Among those influenced were the Russian Alexander Afanasyev, the Norwegians Peter Christen AsbjÃ¸rnsen and JÃ¸rgen Moe, the English Joseph Jacobs, and Jeremiah Curtin, an American who collected Irish tales. <s> There was not always a pleased reaction to their collection.

Sodium nitrite is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula NaNO. <s> It is a white to slightly yellowish crystalline powder that is very soluble in water and is hygroscopic. <s> It is a useful precursor to a variety of organic compounds, such as pharmaceuticals, dyes, and pesticides, but it is probably best known as a food additive used in processed meats and (in some countries) in fish products. <s> Sodium nitrite is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines as it is an efficient drug in case of cyanide poisoning. <s> It is used together with sodium thiosulfate. <s> Historically, salt has been used for the preservation of meat. <s> The salt-preserved meatproduct was usually brownish-gray in color. <s> When sodium nitrite is added with the salt, the meat develops a red, then pink color, which is associated with cured meats such as ham, bacon, hot dogs, and bologna. <s> While this chemical will prevent the growth of bacteria, it can be toxic in high amounts for animals and humans. <s> Sodium nitrite's LD in rats is 180 mg/kg and its human LD is 71 mg/kg, meaning a 65 kg person would likely have to consume at least 4.6 g to result in death. <s> To prevent toxicity, sodium nitrite (blended with salt) sold as a food additive is dyed bright pink to avoid mistaking it for plain salt or sugar. <s> Nitrites are not naturally occurring in vegetables in significant quantities.

The Second Battle of Guam (21 July â€“ 10 August 1944) was the American recapture of the Japanese-held island of Guam, a U.S. territory in the Mariana Islands captured by the Japanese from the U.S. in the 1941 First Battle of Guam during the Pacific campaign of World War II. <s> Guam, at 212 square miles (543 square kilometers), is the largest island of the Marianas, with a length of 32 miles (52 km) and a width ranging from 12 miles (19.31 km) to four miles (6.44 km) at different points of the island. <s> It had been a United States possession since its capture from Spain in 1898 until it was captured by the Japanese on 10 December 1941, following the attack on Pearl Harbor. <s> During the Japanese occupation of Guam, it was not as heavily fortified as the other Mariana Islands such as Saipan that had been Japanese possessions since the end of World War I. <s> But by 1944, Guam had a large Japanese garrison. <s> The Allied plan for the invasion of the Marianas, Operation "Forager", called for heavy preliminary bombardment, first by carrier aircraft and USAAF bombers based in the Marshall Islands to the east, then once air superiority was gained, close bombardment by battleships, cruisers, and destroyers. <s> Saipan, Tinian, and Guam were chosen as the targets due to their size, their suitability as a base for supporting the next stage of operations toward the Philippines, Taiwan, and the Ryukyu Islands. <s> The seaport at Apra Harbor was suitable for the largest ships; and air bases for Boeing B-29 Superfortresses could be built from which to bomb Japan. <s> B-24 Liberators from the Marianas could also bomb Iwo Jima and the Bonin Islands, such as Chichi Jima. <s> The invasion of Saipan was scheduled for 15 June 1944, with landings on Guam tentatively set for 18 June. <s> The original timetable was optimistic, however. <s> A large Japanese carrier attack and stubborn resistance by the unexpectedly large Japanese garrison on Saipan led to the invasion of Guam being postponed for a month. <s> Guam, ringed by reefs, cliffs, and heavy surf, presents a formidable challenge for any attacker. <s> Underwater demolition teams reconnoitered the beaches and removed obstacles from 14â€“17 July. <s> Despite the obstacles, on 21 July, the American forces landed on both sides of the Orote Peninsula on the western side of Guam, planning to secure Apra Harbor. <s> The 3rd Marine Division landed near Agana to the north of Orote at 08:29, and the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade landed near Agat to the south. <s> Japanese artillery sank 20 U.S. LVTs and inflicted heavy casualties on the landing troops, especially of the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade, but by 09:00 marines and tanks were ashore at both beaches. <s> By nightfall, the U.S. Marines, and soldiers of the 77th Infantry Division had established beachheads about 2000 m deep. <s> Japanese counterattacks were made throughout the first few days of the battle, mostly at night, using infiltration tactics. <s> The Japanese penetrated the American defenses several times but were driven back with heavy losses of men and equipment. <s> The U.S. Army's 77th Infantry Division had a more difficult landing on 23â€“24 July. <s> Lacking amphibious vehicles, they had to wade ashore from the edge of the reef where the landing craft dropped them off. <s> The men stationed in the 2 beachheads were pinned down by heavy Japanese fire, making initial progress inland quite slow. <s> Supply was very difficult for the landing troops on Guam in the first days of the battle. <s> Landing ships could not come closer than the reef, several hundred yards from the beach and amphibious vehicles were scarce. <s> The 1st Provisional Brigade blocked off the Orote Peninsula on 25 July, and that same night Japanese Lt. General Takashina counterattacked, coordinated with a similar attack against the 3rd Division to the north. <s> The next day, General Obata reported, "our forces failed to achieve the desired objectives." <s> Lieutenant General Takeshi Takashina was killed on 28 July, and Lieutenant General Hideyoshi Obata took over the command of the Japanese defenders. <s> On 28 July, the 2 beachheads were linked, and by 29 July, the Americans secured the peninsula. <s> The Japanese counterattacks against the American beachheads, as well as the fierce fighting, had exhausted the Japanese. <s> At the start of August, they were running out of food and ammunition, and they had only a handful of tanks left. <s> Obata withdrew his troops from southern Guam, planning to make a stand in the mountainous central and northern part of the island, "to engage in delaying action in the jungle in northern Guam to hold the island as long as possible". <s> On 10 August, organized Japanese resistance ended, and Guam was declared secure, but 7,500 Japanese soldiers were estimated to be at large. <s> The next day, Obata committed ritual suicide at his headquarters on Mount Mataguac after he had sent a farewell message to Japan. <s> A few Japanese soldiers held out in the jungle after the fighting on Guam. <s> On 8 December 1945, three U.S. Marines were ambushed and killed. <s> On 24 January 1972, Japanese Army Sergeant Shoichi Yokoi was discovered by hunters on the island. <s> He had lived alone in a cave for 28 years, near Talofofo Falls. <s> Guam was turned into a base for Allied operations after the battle. <s> 5 large airfields were built by the Navy Seabees and African American Aviation Engineering Battalions. <s> Army Air Forces B-29 bombers flew from Northwest Field and North Field on Guam to attack targets in the Western Pacific and on mainland Japan. <s> Liberation Day continues to be celebrated on Guam every 21 July.

Hernandez v. Texas, 347 U.S. 475 (1954), was a landmark case, "the first and only Mexican-American civil-rights case heard and decided by the United States Supreme Court during the post-World War II period." <s> In a unanimous ruling, the court held that Mexican Americans and all other nationality groups in the United States have equal protection under the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. <s> The ruling was written by Justice Earl Warren. <s> This was the first case in which Mexican-American lawyers had appeared before the US Supreme Court. <s> Peter Hernandez, a Mexican-American agricultural worker, was convicted for the 1951 murder of Joe Espinosa. <s> Hernandez's "pro bono" legal team, including Gustavo C. GarciÌa, wanted to challenge what they knew was "the systematic exclusion of persons of Mexican origin from all types of jury duty in at least seventy counties in Texas." <s> They appealed Hernandez's conviction claiming that Mexican Americans were treated as a class apart and subject to social discrimination in Jackson County, where the case had been tried. <s> They were systematically excluded from the grand jury and jury. <s> Hernandez's defense lawyers demonstrated that, although numerous Mexican Americans were citizens and had otherwise qualified for jury duty in Jackson County, during the previous 25 years no Mexican Americans (or, more precisely, no one with a Hispanic surname) were among the 6,000 persons chosen to serve on juries. <s> This resulted in Hernandez having been deprived of equal protection of the law under the Fourteenth Amendment, as juries were restricted by ethnicity. <s> Hernandez and his lawyers appealed to the Texas Supreme Court. <s> They appealed to the United States Supreme Court through a writ of certiorari. <s> The legal team included GarciÌa, Carlos Cadena and John J. Herrera of the League of United Latin American Citizens, and James DeAnda and Cris Alderete of the G. I. Forum, both activist groups for civil rights for Mexican Americans. <s> These were the first Mexican-American lawyers to represent a defendant before the US Supreme Court, which heard their arguments on January 11, 1954. <s> Chief Justice Earl Warren and the rest of the Supreme Court unanimously ruled in favor of Hernandez, and required he be retried by a jury composed without discrimination against Mexican Americans. <s> The Court held that the Fourteenth Amendment protects persons beyond the racial classes of white or black, and extends protection to nationality groups as well. <s> The ruling was an extension of protection in the Civil Rights Movement to nationality groups within the country and an acknowledgement that, in certain times and places, groups other than blacks (African Americans) could be discriminated against. <s> The ultimate effect of this ruling was that the protection of the 14th Amendment was ruled to cover any national or ethnic groups of the United States for which discrimination could be proved.

Hendrik Antoon Lorentz ( ; 18 July 1853 â€“ 4 February 1928) was a Dutch physicist who shared the 1902 Nobel Prize in Physics with Pieter Zeeman for the discovery and theoretical explanation of the Zeeman effect. <s> He also derived the transformation equations underpinning Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity. <s> Hendrik Lorentz was born in Arnhem, Gelderland, Netherlands, the son of Gerrit Frederik Lorentz (1822â€“1893), a well-off horticulturist, and Geertruida van Ginkel (1826â€“1861). <s> In 1862, after his mother's death, his father married Luberta Hupkes. <s> Despite being raised as a Protestant, he was a freethinker in religious matters. <s> From 1866 to 1869, he attended the "Hogere Burger School" in Arnhem, a new type of public high school recently established by Johan Rudolph Thorbecke. <s> His results in school were exemplary; not only did he excel in the physical sciences and mathematics, but also in English, French, and German. <s> In 1870, he passed the exams in classical languages which were then required for admission to University. <s> In 1905, Einstein would use many of the concepts, mathematical tools and results Lorentz discussed to write his paper entitled "On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies", known today as the theory of special relativity. <s> Because Lorentz laid the fundamentals for the work by Einstein, this theory was originally called the "Lorentz-Einstein theory". <s> Lorentz was one of few scientists who supported Einstein's search for general relativity from the beginning â€“ he wrote several research papers and discussed with Einstein personally and by letter. <s> For instance, he attempted to combine Einstein's formalism with Hamilton's principle (1915), and to reformulate it in a coordinate-free way (1916). <s> In January 1928, Lorentz became seriously ill, and died shortly after on February 4.

SÌŒKODA AUTO (] ), more commonly known as SÌŒkoda, is a Czech automobile manufacturer founded in 1895 as Laurin & Klement. <s> Its headquarters are in MladaÌ Boleslav, Czech Republic. <s> In 1925 Laurin & Klement was acquired by the industrial conglomerate SÌŒkoda Works, which itself became state owned in 1948. <s> After 1991 it was gradually privatized and in 2000 SÌŒkoda became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Volkswagen Group. <s> The SÌŒkoda Works were established as an arms manufacturer in 1859. <s> SÌŒKODA AUTO (and its predecessors) is one of the five oldest companies producing cars and has an unbroken history alongside Daimler, Opel, Peugeot and Tatra. <s> As with many long-established car manufacturers, the company which would become SÌŒkoda Auto started in the early 1890s by manufacturing bicycles. <s> SÌŒkoda (then Laurin & Klement) factories were founded in 1896 as a velocipede manufacturer. <s> In 1894 (1894) , 26-year-old VaÌclav Klement, who was a bookseller in MladaÌ Boleslav, Kingdom of Bohemia (today's Czech Republic, then part of Austria-Hungary), was unable to obtain spare parts to repair his German bicycle. <s> Klement returned his bicycle to the manufacturers, Seidel and Naumann, with a letter, in Czech, asking them to carry out repairs, only to receive a reply, in German, stating: "If you want us to answer you, we insist that you convey your message in a language we understand." <s> Not satisfied with the reply and realising the business potential, Klement, despite having no technical experience, decided to start a bicycle repair shop, which he and VaÌclav Laurin opened in 1896 in MladaÌ Boleslav. <s> Before going into partnership with Klement, Laurin was an established bicycle manufacturer in the nearby town of Turnov. <s> In 1898, after moving to their newly built factory, the pair bought a Werner "Motocyclette". <s> Laurin & Klement's first motorcyclette, powered by an engine mounted on the handlebars driving the front wheels, proved dangerous and unreliable â€” an early accident on it cost Laurin a front tooth. <s> To design a safer machine with its structure around the engine, the pair wrote to German ignition specialist Robert Bosch for advice on a different electromagnetic system. <s> Their new "Slavia" motorcycle made its debut in 1899 and the company became the first motorcycle factory in Central Europe. <s> In 1900, with a company workforce of 32, Slavia exports began and 150 machines were shipped to London for the Hewtson firm. <s> Shortly afterwards, the press credited them as makers of the first motorcycle. <s> By 1905, the firm was manufacturing automobiles, making it the second-oldest car manufacturer in the Czech lands after Tatra. <s> The company, with an area of 7800 m2 , had a workforce of 320 and used 170 special machine-tools, power-driven by 100 hp of steam power. <s> The first model, Voiturette A, was a success and the company was established both within Austria-Hungary and internationally. <s> After World War I the Laurin & Klement company began producing trucks, but in 1924, after running into problems and being affected by a fire on their premises, the company sought a new partner. <s> Meanwhile, ""AkciovaÌ spolecÌŒnost, drÌŒiÌve SÌŒkodovy zaÌvody"" (Limited Company, formerly the SÌŒkoda Works), an arms manufacturer and multi-sector concern in Pilsen which had become one of the largest industrial enterprises in Europe and the largest in Czechoslovakia, sought to enlarge its non-arms manufacturing base and acquired Laurin & Klement in 1925. <s> It also started manufacturing cars in cooperation with Hispano-Suiza. <s> Most of the later production took place under SÌŒkoda's name. <s> An assembly line was used for production from 1930 onwards. <s> In the same year a formal spin-off of the car manufacture into a new company, "AkciovaÌ spolecÌŒnost pro automobilovyÌ pruÌŠmysl" or abbreviated "ASAP", took place. <s> ASAP remained a wholly owned subsidiary of the SÌŒkoda Works and continued to sell cars under the SÌŒkoda marque. <s> Apart from the factory in MladaÌ Boleslav it included also the firm's representation, sales offices and services, as well as a central workshop in Prague. <s> At the time, the car factory in MladaÌ Boleslav covered an area of 215,000 square metres and employed 3,750 blue-collar and 500 white-collar workers. <s> After a decline caused by the economic depression, SÌŒkoda introduced a new line of cars in the 1930s which significantly differed from its previous products. <s> A new design of chassis with backbone tube and all-around independent suspension was developed under the leadership of chief engineer VladimiÌr MatousÌŒ and modelled on the one first introduced by Hans Ledwinka in Tatra. <s> First used on model SÌŒkoda 420 Standard in 1933, it aimed at solving insufficient torsional stiffness of the ladder frame. <s> During the occupation of Czechoslovakia in World War II the SÌŒkoda Works were turned into part of the "Reichswerke Hermann GoÌˆring" serving the German war effort by producing components for military terrain vehicles, military planes, other weapon components and cartridge cases. <s> Vehicle output decreased from 7,052 in 1939 to 683 in 1944, of which only 35 were passenger cars. <s> A total of 316 trucks were produced between January and May 1945. <s> The UK and US air forces bombed the SÌŒkoda works repeatedly between 1940 and 1945. <s> The final massive air raid took place on 25 April 1945 and resulted in almost the complete destruction of the SÌŒkoda armament works and about 1,000 dead or injured. <s> In 2017 Auto Shanghai, SÌŒkoda displayed its Vision E concept for an all-electric 300bhp coupeÌ-SUV, with level 3 autonomy capability and 500 km

Classical mechanics describes the motion of macroscopic objects, from projectiles to parts of machinery, and astronomical objects, such as spacecraft, planets, stars and galaxies. <s> If the present state of an object is known it is possible to predict by the laws of classical mechanics how it will move in the future (determinism) and how it has moved in the past (reversibility). <s> Classical mechanics uses common-sense notions of how matter and forces exist and interact. <s> It assumes that matter and energy have definite, knowable attributes such as location in space and speed. <s> Non-relativistic mechanics also assumes that forces act instantaneously (see also Action at a distance). <s> Acceleration represents the velocity's change over time. <s> Velocity can change in either magnitude or direction, or both. <s> Occasionally, a decrease in the magnitude of velocity ""v"" is referred to as "deceleration", but generally any change in the velocity over time, including deceleration, is simply referred to as acceleration. <s> The quantity "m"v is called the (canonical) momentum. <s> The net force on a particle is thus equal to the rate of change of the momentum of the particle with time. <s> Newton founded his principles of natural philosophy on three proposed laws of motion: the law of inertia, his second law of acceleration (mentioned above), and the law of action and reaction; and hence laid the foundations for classical mechanics. <s> Both Newton's second and third laws were given the proper scientific and mathematical treatment in Newton's "PhilosophiÃ¦ Naturalis Principia Mathematica."
