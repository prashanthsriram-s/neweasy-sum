Aneuploidy is the presence of an abnormal number of chromosomes in a cell, for example a human cell having 45 or 47 chromosomes instead of the usual 46. <s> It does not include a difference of one or more complete sets of chromosomes. <s> A cell with any number of complete chromosome sets is called a "euploid" cell. <s> An extra or missing chromosome is a common cause of genetic disorders, including some human birth defects. <s> Some cancer cells also have abnormal numbers of chromosomes. <s> Aneuploidy originates during cell division when the chromosomes do not separate properly between the two cells. <s> Most cases of aneuploidy result in miscarriage and the most common extra autosomal chromosomes among live births are 21, 18, and 13. <s> Most embryos cannot survive with a missing or extra autosome (numbered chromosome) and are spontaneously aborted. <s> The most frequent aneuploidy in humans is trisomy 16, although fetuses affected with the full version of this chromosome abnormality do not survive to term (it is possible for surviving individuals to have the mosaic form, where trisomy 16 exists in some cells but not all). <s> The most common aneuploidy that infants can survive with is trisomy 21, which is found in Down syndrome, affecting 1 in 800 births. <s> Trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome) affects 1 in 6,000 births, and trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome) affects 1 in 10,000 births.

There are infinitely many non-similar shapes of icosahedra, some of them being more symmetrical than others. <s> The best known is the (convex, non-stellated) regular icosahedronâ€”one of the Platonic solidsâ€”whose faces are 20 equilateral triangles. <s> There are two objects, one convex and one nonconvex, that can both be called regular icosahedra. <s> Each has 30 edges and 20 equilateral triangle faces with five meeting at each of its twelve vertices. <s> Both have icosahedral symmetry. <s> The term "regular icosahedron" generally refers to the convex variety, while the nonconvex form is called a "great icosahedron". <s> The convex regular icosahedron is usually referred to simply as the "regular icosahedron", one of the five regular Platonic solids, and is represented by its SchlaÌˆfli symbol {3, 5}, containing 20 triangular faces, with 5 faces meeting around each vertex. <s> Its dual polyhedron is the regular dodecahedron {5, 3} having three regular pentagonal faces around each vertex. <s> The great icosahedron is one of the four regular star Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra. <s> Its SchlaÌˆfli symbol is {3, }. <s> Like the convex form, it also has 20 equilateral triangle faces, but its vertex figure is a pentagram rather than a pentagon, leading to geometrically intersecting faces. <s> The intersections of the triangles do not represent new edges. <s> Its dual polyhedron is the great stellated dodecahedron { , 3}, having three regular star pentagonal faces around each vertex. <s> Stellation is the process of extending the faces or edges of a polyhedron until they meet to form a new polyhedron. <s> It is done symmetrically so that the resulting figure retains the overall symmetry of the parent figure. <s> In their book "The Fifty-Nine Icosahedra", Coxeter et al. enumerated 58 such stellations of the regular icosahedron. <s> Of these, many have a single face in each of the 20 face planes and so are also icosahedra. <s> The great icosahedron is among them. <s> Other stellations have more than one face in each plane or form compounds of simpler polyhedra. <s> These are not strictly icosahedra, although they are often referred to as such.

On Wikipedia, trusted users may be appointed as administrators (also known as admins, sysops, and janitors), following a successful request for adminship. <s> As of 2019, there are administrators on the English Wikipedia. <s> Administrators have additional technical privileges compared with other editors. <s> On Wikipedia, becoming an admin is often referred to as being "given or taking up the mop", a term which has also been used elsewhere. <s> In 2006, "The New York Times" reported that administrators on Wikipedia, of whom there were then about 1,000, were "geographically diverse". <s> In July 2012, it was widely reported that Wikipedia was "running out of administrators", because in 2005 and 2006, 40 to 50 people were often appointed administrators each month, but in the first half of 2012, only nine in total were appointed. <s> However, Jimmy Wales, Wikipedia's co-founder, denied that this was a crisis or that Wikipedia was running out of admins, saying, "The number of admins has been stable for about two years, there's really nothing going on." <s> Wales had previously (in a message sent to the English Wikipedia mailing list on February 11, 2003) stated that being an admin is "not a big deal", and that "It's merely a technical matter that the powers given to sysops are not given out to everyone." <s> In his book "Wikipedia â€“ The Missing Manual", John Broughton states that while many people think of administrators on Wikipedia as judges, that is not the purpose of the role. <s> Instead, he says, admins usually "delete pages" and "protect pages involved in edit wars". <s> While the first Wikipedia administrators were appointed by Jimmy Wales in October 2001, administrator privileges on Wikipedia are now granted through a process known as requests for adminship (RfA). <s> Any registered editor may nominate themselves, or may request another editor to do so. <s> The process has been said to be "akin to putting someone through the Supreme Court" by Andrew Lih, a scientist and professor who is himself an administrator on the English Wikipedia. <s> Lih also said, "It's pretty much a hazing ritual at this point", in contrast to how the process worked early in Wikipedia's history, when all one had to do to become an admin was "prove you weren't a bozo". <s> Candidacy for the role is normally considered only after "extensive work on the wiki". <s> While any editor may vote in an RfA, the outcome is not determined by a majority vote, but rather by whether or not consensus has been reached that the candidate would make a good administrator, a decision which can only be made by a bureaucrat, a Wikipedia editor who is also appointed by the community through a "request" process, though the process is much stricter for them than for administrators. <s> This may have been implemented as a result of RfAs attracting increasing levels of attention: Stvilia et al. quoted that "Prior to mid-2005, RfAs typically did not attract much attention. <s> Since then, it has become quite common for RfAs to attract huge numbers of RfA groupies who all support one another". <s> Once granted administrator privileges, a user has access to additional functions in order to perform certain duties. <s> These include "messy cleanup work", deletion of articles deemed unsuitable, protecting pages (restricting editing privileges to that page), and blocking the accounts of disruptive users. <s> Blocking a user must be done according to Wikipedia's policies and a reason must be stated for the block, which will be permanently logged by the software. <s> Use of this privilege to "gain editing advantages" is considered inappropriate. <s> A scientific paper by researchers from Virginia Tech and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute found that after editors are promoted to administrator status, they often focus more on articles about controversial topics than they did before. <s> The researchers also proposed an alternative method for choosing administrators, in which more weight is given to the votes of experienced editors. <s> Another paper, presented at the 2008 Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, analyzed data from all 1,551 requests for adminship from January 2006 to October 2007, with the goal of determining which (if any) of the criteria recommended in Wikipedia's "Guide to requests for adminship" page were the best predictors of whether the user in question would actually become an admin. <s> In December 2013, a similar study was published by researchers from the Polish-Japanese Institute of Information Technology in Warsaw which aimed to model the results of requests for adminship on the Polish Wikipedia using a model derived from Wikipedia's edit history. <s> They found that they could "classify the votes in the RfA procedures using this model with an accuracy level that should be sufficient to recommend candidates."

County Cavan is a county in Ireland. <s> It is in the province of Ulster and is part of the Border Region. <s> It is named after the town of Cavan and is based on the historic Gaelic territory of East Breffny ("BreÌifne"). <s> Cavan County Council is the local authority for the county, which had a population of 76,176 at the 2016 census. <s> Cavan borders six counties: Leitrim to the west, Fermanagh and Monaghan to the north, Meath to the south-east, Longford to the south-west and Westmeath to the south. <s> Cavan shares a 70 km border with County Fermanagh in Northern Ireland. <s> Cavan is the 19th largest of the 32 counties in area and the 25th largest by population. <s> The county is characterised by drumlin countryside dotted with many lakes and hills. <s> The north-western area of the county is sparsely populated and mountainous. <s> The Breifne Mountains contain the highest point, Cuilcagh, at 665 m . <s> Cavan is the source of many rivers. <s> Shannon Pot on the slopes of Cuilcagh is the source of the River Shannon, the longest river in Ireland at 386 km . <s> The River Erne is a major river which rises from Beaghy Lough, two miles (3 km) south of Stradone in Cavan and flows for 120 km to Lough Erne. <s> Other rivers in the county include the Blackwater River, which rises near Bailieborough and flows through Lough Ramor, joining the River Boyne at Navan; the Dee which springs near Bailieborough; the River Annalee which flows from Lough Sillan and joins the Erne; and the Cladagh river which rises from Cuilcagh and flows into Fermanagh. <s> The Glyde and the Owenroe also source in Cavan. <s> Cavan is known as 'The Lakeland County' and is reputed to contain 365 lakes. <s> At 18.8 km2 , Lough Sheelin is the county's largest lake; it is situated in the south of the county and forms a three way border on its waters between counties Meath, Westmeath and Cavan. <s> A large complex of lakes form in the north and west of Cavan into designated Specially Protected Areas (SPA); an example is Lough Oughter. <s> Other important wildlife protected lakes such as Lough Gowna and Lough Ramor are in the south and east of the county. <s> Cavan has a mainly hilly (drumlin) landscape and contains just under 7000 ha of forested area, 3.6% of Cavan's total land area. <s> The county contains forests such as Bellamont Forest near Cootehill, Killykeen Forest Park at Lough Oughter (a Coillte state forest concern), DuÌn na RiÌ Forest Park and the Burren Forest. <s> In medieval times, the area of Cavan was part of the petty kingdom of East BreÌifne or Brefney O'Reilly after its ruling Gaelic family. <s> This in turn was a division of the 11th century Kingdom of BreÌifne. <s> For this reason the county is colloquially known as the Breffni County. <s> A high degree of defence was achieved by using the natural landscape of drumlin hills and loughs. <s> The poorly drained heavy clay soils contributed as an obstacle against invasion. <s> Historically, Cavan was part of the western province of Connacht, but was transferred to Ulster in 1584 following the composition of Breifne. <s> In the south, the Lough Sheelin area was part of Leinster until the late 14th century. <s> Parts of Cavan were subjected to Norman influence from the twelfth century and the remains of several motte and bailie fortifications are still visible mainly in the east of the county, as well as the remains of stronger works such as Castlerahan and Clogh Oughter castle. <s> The influence of several monastic orders also owes its origins to around this time with abbey remains existent in locations such as Drumlane and Trinity Island. <s> The Plantation of Ulster from 1610 saw the settlement and origins of several new towns within the county that include Bailieborough, Cootehill, Killeshandra and Virginia. <s> Existing towns such as Cavan and Belturbet became over time more important as trading centres. <s> Wars during the mid-seventeenth century aimed at trying to unsettle the Plantation only led to further plantations of English and Scottish settlers into the county and the beginnings of a thriving flax and linen industry. <s> Agriculture is the largest industry in the county, especially dairy milk processing as well as pig and beef farming. <s> Much of Cavan's land consists of clay soils, which are rich in minerals, but heavy and poorly drained, making pasture farming the dominant farming system in the county. <s> There is a total farmed area of 144269 ha in the county, and there are approximately 219,568 cattle in Cavan. <s> Lakeland Dairies Group, which is based in Killeshandra and has manufacturing sites located throughout Cavan, is Ireland's second largest dairy co-operative with an annual revenue of â‚¬545 million. <s> Cavan is one of Ireland's leading counties for pig production, with the county's farms raising a fifth of the national pig herd. <s> Pig farming regulations have put pressure on the industry, which is highly dependent on affordable credit. <s> Traditionally an agricultural economy, Cavan has since expanded in other industries, chiefly quarrying, energy production and manufacturing facilities. <s> As of April 2012, Cavan produces 122.02 megawatts of wind energy. <s> The largest wind farm is at Bindoo, which produces 48 megawatts of energy. <s> Peat cutting exists in the northwest of the county, in the Cuilcagh range. <s> Major industries such as Quinn Quaries and Gypsum Industries are also important employers within the county.

S/2004 S 6 is the provisional designation of a dusty object seen orbiting Saturn very close to the F ring. <s> It is not clear whether it is only a transient clump of dust, or if there is a solid moonlet at its core. <s> It was first seen by scientists in images taken by the Cassini-Huygens probe on October 28, 2004 and announced on November 8 that year. <s> It appears to be the best tracked object in this region with at least five probable sightings in the period to late 2005. <s> In comparison, two objects in the F ring's vicinity (S/2004 S 3 and S/2004 S 4 ) that were first seen several months earlier have not been recovered with any confidence. <s> Nevertheless, it continues to be unclear whether there is a solid core to S/2004 S 6 or whether it is just a transient dust clump that will dissipate on a timescale of years or months. <s> Notably, an imaging sequence covering an entire orbital period at 4 km resolution taken on November 15, 2004 (soon after S/2004 S 6 's discovery) failed to recover the object, while it has been seen again later. <s> The lighting conditions in S/2004 S 6 's part of the orbit were different during these two observations, however, with the discovery being made when the region was strongly backlit by the sun. <s> A suggested resolution of the absence in November is that S/2004 S 6 's visibility is primarily due to a diffuse cloud of fine dust that is much brighter in forward scattered light (the conditions of the discovery image), and that the solid core (if any) is small. <s> S/2004 S 6 has been seen both inside and outside the main F ring, and its orbit must cross the ring. <s> Careful calculations show that the object periodically plows through the ring material, coming within 1.5 km of the densest core e.g. on 9 April 2005. <s> It has been suggested that a spiral structure in the tenuous material surrounding the F ring may have been a consequence of this. <s> The dusty halo seen in images is sizeable, being around 2000 km in lengthwise extent. <s> The solid object, if any, would be no greater than 3â€“5 km in diameter based on brightness.

A (named , plural "As", "A's", "a"s, "a's" or "aes" ) is the first letter and the first vowel of the modern English alphabet and the ISO basic Latin alphabet. <s> It is similar to the Ancient Greek letter alpha, from which it derives. <s> The uppercase version consists of the two slanting sides of a triangle, crossed in the middle by a horizontal bar. <s> The lowercase version can be written in two forms: the double-storey a and single-storey É‘. <s> The latter is commonly used in handwriting and fonts based on it, especially fonts intended to be read by children, and is also found in italic type. <s> The earliest certain ancestor of "A" is aleph (also written 'aleph), the first letter of the Phoenician alphabet, which consisted entirely of consonants (for that reason, it is also called an abjad to distinguish it from a true alphabet). <s> In turn, the ancestor of aleph may have been a pictogram of an ox head in proto-Sinaitic script influenced by Egyptian hieroglyphs, styled as a triangular head with two horns extended. <s> By 1600 BC, the Phoenician alphabet letter had a linear form that served as the base for some later forms. <s> Its name is thought to have corresponded closely to the Paleo-Hebrew or Arabic aleph. <s> When the ancient Greeks adopted the alphabet, they had no use for a letter to represent the glottal stopâ€”the consonant sound that the letter denoted in Phoenician and other Semitic languages, and that was the first phoneme of the Phoenician pronunciation of the letterâ€”so they used their version of the sign to represent the vowel /a/ , and called it by the similar name of alpha. <s> In the earliest Greek inscriptions after the Greek Dark Ages, dating to the 8th century BC, the letter rests upon its side, but in the Greek alphabet of later times it generally resembles the modern capital letter, although many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg, or by the angle at which the cross line is set. <s> The Etruscans brought the Greek alphabet to their civilization in the Italian Peninsula and left the letter unchanged. <s> The Romans later adopted the Etruscan alphabet to write the Latin language, and the resulting letter was preserved in the Latin alphabet that would come to be used to write many languages, including English. <s> In algebra, the letter "a" along with other letters at the beginning of the alphabet is used to represent known quantities, whereas the letters at the end of the alphabet ("x", "y", "z") are used to denote unknown quantities. <s> In geometry, capital A, B, C etc. are used to denote segments, lines, rays, etc. <s> A capital A is also typically used as one of the letters to represent an angle in a triangle, the lowercase a representing the side opposite angle A.

The citric acid cycle (CAC) â€“ also known as the" TCA cycle (tricarboxylic acid cycle) " or the" Krebs cycle "â€“ is a series of chemical reactions used by all aerobic organisms to release stored energy through the oxidation of acetyl-CoA derived from carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, into adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and carbon dioxide. <s> In addition, the cycle provides precursors of certain amino acids, as well as the reducing agent NADH, that are used in numerous other reactions. <s> Its central importance to many biochemical pathways suggests that it was one of the earliest established components of cellular metabolism and may have originated abiogenically. <s> Even though it is branded as a 'cycle', it is not necessary for metabolites to follow only one specific route; at least three segments of the citric acid cycle have been recognized. <s> Because two acetyl-CoA molecules are produced from each glucose molecule, two cycles are required per glucose molecule. <s> Therefore, at the end of two cycles, the products are: two GTP, six NADH, two QH, and four CO.

The Northrop (later Northrop Grumman) B-2 Spirit, also known as the Stealth Bomber, is an American heavy strategic bomber, featuring low observable stealth technology designed for penetrating dense anti-aircraft defenses; it is a flying wing design with a crew of two. <s> The bomber can deploy both conventional and thermonuclear weapons, such as up to eighty 500 lb Mk 82 JDAM Global Positioning System-guided bombs, or sixteen 2400 lb B83 nuclear bombs. <s> The B-2 is the only acknowledged aircraft that can carry large air-to-surface standoff weapons in a stealth configuration. <s> Development started under the "Advanced Technology Bomber" (ATB) project during the Carter administration; its expected performance was one of the President's reasons for the cancellation of the Mach 2 capable B-1A bomber. <s> The ATB project continued during the Reagan administration, but worries about delays in its introduction led to the reinstatement of the B-1 program. <s> Program costs rose throughout development. <s> Designed and manufactured by Northrop, later Northrop Grumman, the cost of each aircraft averaged US$737 million (in 1997 dollars). <s> Total procurement costs averaged $929 million per aircraft, which includes spare parts, equipment, retrofitting, and software support. <s> The total program cost, which included development, engineering and testing, averaged $2.1 billion per aircraft in 1997. <s> Because of its considerable capital and operating costs, the project was controversial in the U.S. Congress. <s> The winding-down of the Cold War in the latter portion of the 1980s dramatically reduced the need for the aircraft, which was designed with the intention of penetrating Soviet airspace and attacking high-value targets. <s> During the late 1980s and 1990s, Congress slashed plans to purchase 132 bombers to 21. <s> In 2008, a B-2 was destroyed in a crash shortly after takeoff, though the crew ejected safely. <s> Twenty B-2s are in service with the United States Air Force, which plans to operate them until 2032. <s> The B-2 is capable of all-altitude attack missions up to 50000 ft , with a range of more than 6000 nmi on internal fuel and over 10000 nmi with one midair refueling. <s> It entered service in 1997 as the second aircraft designed to have advanced stealth technology after the Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk attack aircraft. <s> Though designed originally as primarily a nuclear bomber, the B-2 was first used in combat dropping conventional, non-nuclear ordnance in the Kosovo War in 1999. <s> It later served in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya.

The royal titulary or royal protocol is the standard naming convention taken by the pharaohs of ancient Egypt. <s> It symbolises worldly power and holy might and also acts as a sort of mission statement for the reign of a monarch (sometimes it even changed during the reign). <s> The full titulary, consisting of five names, did not come into standard usage until the Middle Kingdom but remained in use as late as the Roman Empire. <s> G5-O33 The Horus name is the oldest form of the pharaoh's name, originating in prehistoric Egypt. <s> Many of the oldest-known Egyptian pharaohs were known only by this title. <s> The Horus name was usually written in a serekh, a representation of a palace facÌ§ade. <s> The name of the pharaoh was written in hieroglyphs inside this representation of a palace. <s> Typically an image of the falcon god Horus was perched on top of or beside it. <s> At least one Egyptian ruler, the Second Dynasty pharoah Seth-Peribsen, used an image of the god Set instead of Horus, perhaps signifying an internal religious division within the country. <s> He was succeeded by Khasekhemwy, who placed the symbols of both Set and Horus above his name. <s> Thereafter, the image of Horus always appeared alongside the name of the pharaoh. <s> By the time of the New Kingdom, the Horus name was often written without the enclosing serekh. <s> The name is first definitively used by the First Dynasty pharaoh Semerkhet, though it only became a fully independent title by the Twelfth Dynasty. <s> This particular name was not typically framed by a cartouche or serekh, but always begins with the hieroglyphs of a vulture and cobra resting upon two baskets, the dual noun "nebty". <s> G8 Also known as the "Golden Horus Name", this form of the pharaoh's name typically featured the image of a Horus falcon perched above or beside the hieroglyph for gold. <s> The meaning of this particular title has been disputed. <s> One belief is that it represents the triumph of Horus over his uncle Seth, as the symbol for gold can be taken to mean that Horus was "superior to his foes". <s> Gold also was strongly associated in the ancient Egyptian mind with eternity, so this may have been intended to convey the pharaoh's eternal Horus name. <s> Similar to the Nebty name, this particular name typically was not framed by a cartouche or serekh. <s> M23:t-L2:t The pharaoh's throne name, the first of the two names written inside a cartouche, and usually accompanied the title "nsw-bity" ("nsw(t)-bjt(j)"), traditionally interpreted as "He of sedge and bee" and often translated for convenience as "King of Upper and of Lower Egypt", with the sedge and bee being symbols for Upper and Lower Egypt, respectively, although recent research has thrown this interpretation into doubt. <s> The epithet "nb têœ£wy", "Lord of the Two Lands", referring to valley and delta regions of Egypt, often occurs as well. <s> - This was the name given at birth. <s> The name itself was preceded by the title "Son of Ra", written with the hieroglyph of a duck ("za"), a homonym for the word meaning "son" ("za"), adjacent to an image of the sun, a hieroglyph for the chief solar deity Ra. <s> It was first introduced to the set of royal titles in the Fourth Dynasty and emphasizes the king's role as a representative of the solar god Ra. <s> For women who became pharaoh, the preceding title was interpreted as "daughter" also. <s> Modern historians typically refer to the ancient kings of Egypt by this name, adding ordinals (e.g. "II", "III") to distinguish between different individuals bearing the same name.

The golden eagle ("Aquila chrysaetos") is one of the best-known birds of prey in the Northern Hemisphere. <s> It is the most widely distributed species of eagle. <s> Like all eagles, it belongs to the family Accipitridae. <s> These birds are dark brown, with lighter golden-brown plumage on their napes. <s> Immature eagles of this species typically have white on the tail and often have white markings on the wings. <s> Golden eagles use their agility and speed combined with powerful feet and massive, sharp talons to snatch up a variety of prey, mainly hares, rabbits, and marmots and other ground squirrels. <s> Once widespread across the Holarctic, it has disappeared from many areas which are now more heavily populated by humans. <s> Despite being extirpated from or uncommon in some of its former range, the species is still widespread, being present in sizeable stretches of Eurasia, North America, and parts of North Africa. <s> It is the largest and least populous of the five species of true accipitrid to occur as a breeding species in both the Palearctic and the Nearctic.
The Bombyliidae are a family of flies. <s> Their common name are bee flies or humbleflies. <s> Adults generally feed on nectar and pollen, some being important pollinators. <s> Larvae generally are parasitoids of other insects. <s> The Bombyliidae are a large family of flies comprising hundreds of genera, but the lifecycles of most species are known poorly, or not at all. <s> They range in size from very small (2 mm in length) to very large for flies (wingspan of some 40 mm). <s> When at rest, many species hold their wings at a characteristic "swept back" angle. <s> Adults generally feed on nectar and pollen, some being important pollinators, often with spectacularly long probosces adapted to plants such as "Lapeirousia" species with very long, narrow floral tubes. <s> Unlike butterflies, bee flies hold their proboscis straight, and cannot retract it. <s> In parts of East Anglia, locals refer to them as beewhals, thanks to their tusk-like appendages. <s> Many Bombyliidae superficially resemble bees and accordingly the prevalent common name for a member of the family is bee fly. <s> Possibly the resemblance is Batesian mimicry, affording the adults some protection from predators. <s> The larval stages are predators or parasitoids of the eggs and larvae of other insects. <s> The adult females usually deposit eggs in the vicinity of possible hosts, quite often in the burrows of beetles or wasps/solitary bees. <s> Although insect parasitoids usually are fairly host-specific, often highly host-specific, some Bombyliidae are opportunistic and will attack a variety of hosts. <s> The Bombyliidae include at least 4,500 described species, and certainly thousands more remain to be described.

A botanical name is a formal scientific name conforming to the "International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants" (ICN) and, if it concerns a plant cultigen, the additional cultivar or Group epithets must conform to the "International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants" (ICNCP). <s> The code of nomenclature covers "all organisms traditionally treated as algae, fungi, or plants, whether fossil or non-fossil, including blue-green algae (Cyanobacteria), chytrids, oomycetes, slime moulds and photosynthetic protists with their taxonomically related non-photosynthetic groups (but excluding Microsporidia)." <s> The purpose of a formal name is to have a single name that is accepted and used worldwide for a particular plant or plant group. <s> For example, the botanical name "Bellis perennis" denotes a plant species which is native to most of the countries of Europe and the Middle East, where it has accumulated various names in many languages. <s> Later, the plant was introduced worldwide, bringing it into contact with more languages. <s> English names for this plant species include: daisy, English daisy, and lawn daisy. <s> The cultivar "Bellis perennis" 'Aucubifolia' is a golden-variegated horticultural selection of this species. <s> A botanical name in three parts, i.e., an infraspecific name (a name for a taxon below the rank of species) needs a "connecting term" to indicate rank. <s> In the "Calystegia" example above, this is "subsp.", for subspecies. <s> In botany there are many ranks below that of species (in zoology there is only one such rank, subspecies, so that this "connecting term" is not used in zoology). <s> A name of a "subdivision of a genus" also needs a connecting term (in the "Acacia" example above, this is "subg.", <s> The connecting term is not part of the name itself. <s> For botanical nomenclature, the "ICN" prescribes a two-part name or binary name for any taxon below the rank of genus down to, and including the rank of species. <s> Taxa below the rank of species get a three part (infraspecific name). <s> A binary name consists of the name of a genus and an epithet.

In mathematics, the Riemann sphere, named after Bernhard Riemann, is a model of the extended complex plane, the complex plane plus a point at infinity. <s> This extended plane represents the extended complex numbers, that is, the complex numbers plus a value âˆž for infinity. <s> With the Riemann model, the point "âˆž" is near to very large numbers, just as the point "0" is near to very small numbers. <s> The extended complex numbers are useful in complex analysis because they allow for division by zero in some circumstances, in a way that makes expressions such as formula_1 well-behaved. <s> For example, any rational function on the complex plane can be extended to a holomorphic function on the Riemann sphere, with the poles of the rational function mapping to infinity. <s> More generally, any meromorphic function can be thought of as a holomorphic function whose codomain is the Riemann sphere. <s> In geometry, the Riemann sphere is the prototypical example of a Riemann surface, and is one of the simplest complex manifolds. <s> In projective geometry, the sphere can be thought of as the complex projective line P(C), the projective space of all complex lines in C.

Historians and political scientists consider the Second Party System to be a term of periodization to designate the political party system operating in the United States from about 1828 to 1854, after the First Party System ended. <s> The system was characterized by rapidly rising levels of voter interest, beginning in 1828, as demonstrated by Election Day turnouts, rallies, partisan newspapers, and high degrees of personal loyalty to parties. <s> Two major parties dominated the political landscape: the Democratic Party, led by Andrew Jackson, and the Whig Party, assembled by Henry Clay from the National Republicans and from other opponents of Jackson. <s> Minor parties included the Anti-Masonic Party, an important innovator from 1827 to 1834; the abolitionist Liberty Party in 1840; and the anti-slavery expansion Free Soil Party in 1848 and 1852. <s> The Second Party System reflected and shaped the political, social, economic and cultural currents of the Jacksonian Era, until succeeded by the Third Party System. <s> Historian Richard P. McCormick is most responsible for defining the term. <s> Among the best-known figures on the Democratic side were: Andrew Jackson, Martin Van Buren, John C. Calhoun, James K. Polk, Lewis Cass, and Stephen Douglas. <s> On the Whig side were John Quincy Adams, Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, William H. Seward, and Thurlow Weed. <s> The 1824 presidential election operated without political parties and came down to a four-man race. <s> Each candidate (Henry Clay, William Crawford, Andrew Jackson, and John Quincy Adams), all of whom were nominally Democratic Republicans, had a regional base of support involving factions in the various states. <s> With no electoral college majority, the choice devolved on the United States House of Representatives. <s> Clay was not among the three finalists, but as Speaker of the House he negotiated the settlement. <s> Jackson, despite having won the most popular votes and the most electoral votes, was not elected. <s> John Quincy Adams, son of former President John Adams, was elected, and he immediately chose Clay as Secretary of State. <s> Jackson loudly denounced this "corrupt bargain." <s> Campaigning vigorously he launched a crusade against the corruption he saw in Washington. <s> Appealing both to local militia companies (as the most famous of the nation's Indian fighters, and a hero of the War of 1812) and to state political factions, Jackson assembled a coalition, the embryonic Democratic Party, that ousted Adams in 1828. <s> Martin Van Buren, brilliant leader of New York politics, was Jackson's key aide, bringing along the large electoral votes of Virginia and Pennsylvania. <s> His reward was appointment as Secretary of State and later nomination and election to the vice presidency as heir to the Jacksonian tradition. <s> The Adams-Clay wing of the Democratic-Republican Party became known as the National Republicans, although Adams never considered himself a loyal member of the party. <s> Jackson considered himself a reformer, but he was committed to the old ideals of Republicanism, and bitterly opposed anything that smacked of special favors for special interests. <s> While Jackson never engaged in a duel as president, he had shot political opponents before and was just as determined to destroy his enemies on the battlefields of politics. <s> The Second Party System came about primarily because of Jackson's determination to destroy the Second Bank of the United States. <s> Headquartered in Philadelphia, with offices in major cities around the country, the federally chartered Bank operated somewhat like a central bank (like the Federal Reserve System a century later). <s> Local bankers and politicians annoyed by the controls exerted by Nicholas Biddle grumbled loudly. <s> Jackson did not like any banks (paper money was anathema to Jackson; he believed only gold and silver "specie" should circulate.) <s> After Herculean battles with Henry Clay, his chief antagonist, Jackson finally broke Biddle's bank. <s> Jackson continued to attack the banking system. <s> His "Specie Circular" of July 1836 rejected paper money issued by banks (it could no longer be used to buy federal land), insisting on gold and silver coins. <s> Most businessmen and bankers (but not all) went over to the Whig party, and the commercial and industrial cities became Whig strongholds. <s> Jackson meanwhile became even more popular with the subsistence farmers and day laborers who distrusted bankers and finance. <s> Jackson systematically used the federal patronage system, what was called the "Spoils System". <s> Jackson not only rewarded past supporters; he promised future jobs if local and state politicians joined his team. <s> As Syrett explains: When Jackson became President, he implemented the theory of rotation in office, declaring it "a leading principle in the republican creed." <s> He believed that rotation in office would prevent the development of a corrupt civil service. <s> On the other hand, Jackson's supporters wanted to use the civil service to reward party loyalists to make the party stronger. <s> In practice, this meant replacing civil servants with friends or party loyalists into those offices. <s> The spoils system did not originate with Jackson. <s> It originated under Thomas Jefferson when he removed Federalist office-holders after becoming president. <s> Also, Jackson did not out the entire civil service. <s> At the end of his term, Jackson had only dismissed less than twenty percent of the original civil service. <s> While Jackson did not start the spoils system, he did encourage its growth and it became a central feature of the Second Party System, as well as the Third Party System, until it ended in the 1890s. <s> As one historian explains: "Although Jackson dismissed far fewer government employees than most of his contemporaries imagined and although he did not originate the spoils system, he made more sweeping changes in the Federal bureaucracy than had any of his predecessors.

A Philosopher Lecturing on the Orrery, or the full title, A Philosopher giving a Lecture on the Orrery in which a lamp is put in place of the Sun, is a 1766 painting by Joseph Wright of Derby depicting a lecturer giving a demonstration of an orrery to a small audience. <s> It is now in the Derby Museum and Art Gallery The painting preceded his similar "An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump" (National Gallery, London). <s> In both of these works, the candlelit setting had a realist justification. <s> Viewing sculpture by candlelight, when the contours showed well, and there might even be an impression of movement from the flickering light, was a fashionable practice described by Goethe. <s> In the orrery demonstration the shadows cast by the lamp representing the Sun were an essential part of the display. <s> But there seems no reason other than heightened drama to stage the air pump experiment in a room lit by a single candle, and in two later paintings of the subject by Charles-AmeÌdeÌe-Philippe van Loo the lighting is normal. <s> An anonymous review from the time called Wright "a very great and uncommon genius in a peculiar way". <s> "The Orrery" was painted without a commission, probably in the expectation that it would be bought by Washington Shirley, 5th Earl Ferrers, an amateur astronomer who had an orrery of his own, and with whom Wright's friend Peter Perez Burdett was staying while in Derbyshire. <s> Figures thought to be portraits of Burdett and Ferrers feature in the painting, Burdett taking notes and Ferrers seated with a youth next to the orrery. <s> Ferrers purchased the painting, which was exhibited in 1766, for Â£210, but the 6th Earl auctioned it off, and it is now in the Derby Museum and Art Gallery, where it is on permanent display, close to a working replica of a full-sized mechanical Grand Orrery. <s> A biographer of Wright, Benedict Nicolson, argued in 1968 that John Whitehurst was the model for the lecturer, while another commentator points out the figure's resemblance to "a painting of Isaac Newton by Godfrey Kneller". <s> Close observation of the adult faces in the picture reveals that each one demonstrates one or other of the main phases of the Moon â€“ new moon, half moon, gibbous moon and full moon.

Child abuse or child maltreatment is physical, sexual, and/or psychological maltreatment or neglect of a child or children, especially by a parent or a caregiver. <s> Child abuse may include any act or failure to act by a parent or a caregiver that results in actual or potential harm to a child, and can occur in a child's home, or in the organizations, schools or communities the child interacts with. <s> The World Health Organization (WHO) defines "child abuse" and "child maltreatment" as "all forms of physical and/or emotional ill-treatment, sexual abuse, neglect or negligent treatment or commercial or other exploitation, resulting in actual or potential harm to the child's health, survival, development or dignity in the context of a relationship of responsibility, trust or power." <s> In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) uses the term "child maltreatment" to refer to both acts of commission (abuse), which include "words or overt actions that cause harm, potential harm, or threat of harm to a child", and acts of omission (neglect), meaning "the failure to provide for a child's basic physical, emotional, or educational needs or to protect a child from harm or potential harm". <s> The United States federal Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act defines "child abuse and neglect" as, at minimum, "any recent act or failure to act on the part of a parent or caretaker which results in death, serious physical or emotional harm, sexual abuse or exploitation" or "an act or failure to act which presents an imminent risk of serious harm". <s> Many children who have been abused in any form develop some sort of psychological problem. <s> These problems may include: anxiety, depression, eating disorders, OCD, co-dependency, or even a lack of human connections. <s> There is also a slight tendency for children who have been abused to become child abusers themselves. <s> In the U.S. in 2013, of the 294,000 reported child abuse cases only 81,124 received any sort of counseling or therapy. <s> Treatment is greatly important for abused children.
Amoeboid movement is the most common mode of locomotion in eukaryotic cells. <s> It is a crawling-like type of movement accomplished by protrusion of cytoplasm of the cell involving the formation of pseudopodia ("false-feet") and posterior uropods. <s> One or more pseudopodia may be produced at a time depending on the organism, but all amoeboid movement is characterized by the movement of organisms with an amorphous form that possess no set motility structures. <s> Movement occurs when the cytoplasm slides and forms a pseudopodium in front to pull the cell forward. <s> This type of movement has been linked to changes in action potential, though the exact mechanism is still unknown. <s> Some examples of organisms that exhibit this type of locomotion are the amoeboids, slime molds and some protozoans such as "Naegleria gruberi", as well as some cells in humans such as leukocytes. <s> Sarcomas, or cancers arising from connective tissue cells, are particularly adept at amoeboid movement, thus leading to their high rate of metastasis.

It was best known for the Peripatetic school of philosophy founded there by Aristotle in 334 / 335 BCE . <s> Aristotle fled Athens in 323 BCE , but the school continued to function under a series of leaders until the Roman general Sulla destroyed it during his assault on Athens in 86 BCE. <s> In 335 BCE, Athens fell under Macedonian rule and Aristotle, aged 50, returned from Asia. <s> Upon his return, Aristotle began teaching regularly in the morning in the Lyceum and founded an official school called "The Lyceum". <s> After morning lessons, Aristotle would frequently lecture on the grounds for the public, and manuscripts of his compiled lectures were eventually circulated. <s> The group of scholars who followed the Aristotelian doctrine came to be known as the Peripatetics due to Aristotle's tendency to walk as he taught. <s> Aristotle's main focus as a teacher was cooperative research, an idea which he founded through his natural history work and systematic collection of philosophical works to contribute to his library. <s> His students were assigned historical or scientific research projects as part of their studies. <s> The school was also student run. <s> The students elected a new student administrator to work with the school leadership every ten days, allowing all the students to become involved in turn. <s> Before returning to Athens, Aristotle had been the tutor of Alexander of Macedonia, who became the great conqueror Alexander the Great. <s> Throughout his conquests of various regions, Alexander collected plant and animal specimens for Aristotle's research, allowing Aristotle to develop the first zoo and botanical garden in existence. <s> It is also suspected that Alexander donated what would be the equivalent of more than 4 million dollars to the Lyceum. <s> In 322 BCE , Aristotle was forced to flee Athens with his family when the political leadership reacted against the Macedonians again and his previously published works supporting Macedonian rule left him a target. <s> He passed on his Lyceum to Theophrastus and died later that year in Chalcis, near his hometown.

The Moluccan Sea (Indonesian: "Laut Maluku") is located in the western Pacific Ocean, around the vicinity of Indonesia, specifically bordered by the Indonesian Islands of Celebes (Sulawesi) to the west, Halmahera to the east, and the Sula Islands to the south. <s> The Molucca Sea has a total surface area of 77,000 square miles (200,000 square km). <s> The Molucca Sea is rich in coral and has many diving sites due to the deepness of its waters. <s> The deepness of the water explains the reasoning behind dividing the sea into three zones, which functions to transport water from the Pacific Ocean to the shallower seas surrounding it. <s> The deepest hollow in the Molucca Sea is the 15,780-foot (4,810-meter) Batjan (Indonesian: "Bacan") basin. <s> This region is known for its periodic experiences of earthquakes, which stems from the sea itself being a micro plate, in which the Molucca Sea is being subducted in two opposite directions: one in the direction of the Eurasian Plate to the west and the other in the direction of the Philippines Sea Plate to the east. <s> The Molucca Sea borders the Banda Sea to the south and the Celebes Sea to the west. <s> To the north is Philippine Sea and to the east is Halmahera Sea. <s> The islands bordering the Moluccan Sea include Halmahera to the north east, Buru and Ceram in the centre, and Sulawesi to the west. <s> The Talaud Islands to the north are considered to be the northern border the sea, though the Molucca Sea Plate, the tectonic plate named after the sea, extends further north.

Thomas Leiper Kane (January 27, 1822 â€“ December 26, 1883) was an American attorney, abolitionist, philanthropist, and military officer who was influential in the western migration of the Latter-day Saint movement and served as a Union Army colonel and general of volunteers in the American Civil War. <s> He received a brevet promotion to major general for gallantry at the Battle of Gettysburg. <s> Kane came in contact with members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints during a Philadelphia conference in May 1846. <s> Kane offered them his advice and help in their conflicts with the US government and in their efforts to emigrate to western territories. <s> Jesse C. Little, presiding LDS elder in the East, was soliciting support for the Latter-day Saints' westward migration. <s> Politically well-connected through his father, Kane provided letters of recommendation and later joined Little in Washington, D.C. <s> The two called on the secretary of state, secretary of war, and President James K.

Prince of Orange (or Princess of Orange if the holder is female) is a title originally associated with the sovereign Principality of Orange, in what is now southern France. <s> Under the Treaty of Utrecht of 1713, Frederick William I of Prussia ceded the Principality of Orange to King Louis XIV of France (while retaining the title as part of his dynastic titulature). <s> After William III of England died without children, a dispute arose between Johan Willem Friso and Frederick I of Prussia, which was settled in the Treaty of Partition (1732); consequently, Friso's son, William IV had to share use of the title "Prince of Orange" (which had accumulated prestige in the Netherlands and throughout the Protestant world) with Frederick William I of Prussia. <s> With the emergence of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the title is traditionally borne by the heir apparent of the Dutch monarch. <s> Originally only worn by men, since 1983 the title descends via absolute primogeniture, which means that the holder can be either Prince or Princess of Orange. <s> The Dutch royal dynasty, the House of Orange-Nassau, is not the only family to claim the dynastical title. <s> Rival claims to the title have been made by German emperors and kings of the House of Hohenzollern and by the head of the French noble family of Mailly. <s> The current users of the title are Princess Catharina-Amalia of the Netherlands (Orange-Nassau), Georg Friedrich, Prince of Prussia (Hohenzollern), and Guy, Marquis de Mailly-Nesle (Mailly). <s> The title originally referred to Orange in the Vaucluse department in the Rhone valley of southern France, which was a property of the House of Orange, then of the House of Baux and the House of ChaÌ‚lon-Arlay before passing in 1544 to the House of Orange-Nassau. <s> The last descendant of the original princes, ReneÌ of ChaÌ‚lon, left the principality to his cousin William the Silent, who was not a descendant of the original Orange family but the heir to the principality of Orange by testament, however in violation against the inheritance pattern enacted by the last will of Marie des Baux, the Princess of Orange through kinship to whom Prince ReneÌ derived his own right thereto. <s> In 1673, Louis XIV of France annexed all territory of the principality to France and to the royal domain, as part of the war actions against the stadtholder William III of Orange â€” who later became King William III of Great Britain. <s> Orange ceased to exist as a sovereign realm, de facto. <s> After the marquis (who died in 1713), the next holder was , marquis de Nesle (1689â€“1764). <s> Although no longer descended from Louis-Charles, a branch of the Mailly family still claim the title today. <s> In 1714 Louis XIV bestowed the usufruct of the principality on his kinsman, Louis Armand of Bourbon, Prince de Conti. <s> After his death in 1727 the principality was deemed merged in the Crown by 1731. <s> Because William III died without legitimate children, the principality was regarded as having been inherited by his closest cognate relative on the basis of the testament of Frederic-Henry, Frederick I of Prussia, who ceded the principality â€” at least the lands, but not the formal title â€” to France in 1713. <s> France supported his claim. <s> In this way, the territory of the principality lost its feudal and secular privileges and became a part of France. <s> The Treaty of Utrecht allowed the King of Prussia to erect part of the duchy of Gelderland (the cities of Geldern, Straelen and Wachtendonk with their bailiwicks, Krickenbeck, Viersen, the land of Kessel, the lordships of Afferden, Arcen-Velden-Lomm, Walbeck-Twisteden, Raay and Klein-Kevelaer, Well, Bergen and Middelaar) into a new "Principality of Orange". <s> The kings of Prussia and the German emperors styled themselves Princes of Orange till 1918. <s> An agnatic relative of William III, John William Friso of Nassau, who was also cognatically descended from William the Silent, was designated the heir to the princes of Orange in the Netherlands by the last will of William III. <s> Several of his descendants became stadtholders. <s> They claim the principality of Orange on the basis of agnatic inheritance, similar to that of William the Silent, who had inherited Orange from his cousin ReneÌ of ChaÌ‚lon. <s> They did however have a claim, albeit distant, to the principality itself due to John William Friso's descent from Louise de Coligny, who was a descendant of the original Princes of Orange. <s> (Louise's great grandmother, Anne Pot, Countess of St. Pol, was a descendant of Tiburge d'Orange, who married into the des Baux family) <s> They also claimed on the basis of the testament of Philip William, Maurice and William III. <s> Finally, they claimed on the basis that Orange was an independent state whose sovereign had the right to assign his succession according to his will. <s> France never recognized any of this, nor allowed the Orange-Nassaus or the Hohenzollerns to obtain anything of the principality itself. <s> The Oranje-Nassaus nevertheless assumed the title and also erected several of their lordships into a new principality of Orange. <s> From that derivation of the title comes the tradition of the house of Nassau-Dietz, the later stadtholders of the Netherlands, and the present-day royal family of the Netherlands, of holding this title. <s> They maintain the tradition of William the Silent and the house of Orange-Nassau. <s> Until 1340, it was customary for all sons of the prince of Orange to inherit the title. <s> Only the direct line of descent to Raimond V is shown here. <s> William of Nassau inherited the principality of Orange from his cousin ReneÌ.

In 1974, the Soviets began replacing their AK-47 and AKM rifles with a newer design, the AK-74, which uses 5.45Ã—39mm ammunition. <s> This new rifle and cartridge had only started to be manufactured in Eastern European nations when the Soviet Union collapsed, drastically slowing production of the AK-74 and other weapons of the former Soviet bloc. <s> The AK-47 was designed to be a simple, reliable fully automatic rifle that could be manufactured quickly and cheaply, using mass production methods that were state of the art in the Soviet Union during the late 1940s. <s> The AK-47 uses a long stroke gas system that is generally associated with great reliability in adverse conditions. <s> The large gas piston, generous clearances between moving parts, and tapered cartridge case design allow the gun to endure large amounts of foreign matter and fouling without failing to cycle. <s> The AK-47 and its variants have been and are made in dozens of countries, with "quality ranging from finely engineered weapons to pieces of questionable workmanship." <s> As a result, the AK-47 has a service/system life of approximately 6,000, to 10,000, to 15,000 rounds. <s> The AK-47 was designed to be a cheap, simple, easy to manufacture assault rifle, perfectly matching Soviet military doctrine that treats equipment and weapons as disposable items. <s> As units are often deployed without adequate logistical support and dependent on "battlefield cannibalization" for resupply, it is actually more cost-effective to replace rather than repair weapons. <s> In the pro-communist states, the AK-47 became a symbol of the Third World revolution. <s> They were utilized in the Cambodian Civil War and the Cambodianâ€“Vietnamese War. <s> During the 1980s, the Soviet Union became the principal arms dealer to countries embargoed by Western nations, including Middle Eastern nations such as Iran, Libya, and Syria, which welcomed Soviet Union backing against Israel. <s> After the fall of the Soviet Union, AK-47s were sold both openly and on the black market to any group with cash, including drug cartels and dictatorial states, and more recently they have been seen in the hands of Islamic groups such as Al-Qaeda, ISIL, and the Taliban in Afghanistan and Iraq, and FARC, EjeÌrcito de LiberacioÌn Nacional guerrillas in Colombia. <s> The proliferation of this weapon is reflected by more than just numbers. <s> The AK-47 is included in the flag of Mozambique and its emblem, an acknowledgment that the country gained its independence in large part through the effective use of their AK-47s. <s> It is also found in the coats of arms of East Timor and the revolution era Burkina Faso, as well as in the flags of Hezbollah, Syrian Resistance, FARC-EP, the New People's Army, TKP/TIKKO and the International Revolutionary People's Guerrilla Forces.

Obdurodon tharalkooschild is an extinct species of monotreme in the genus "Obdurodon". <s> It is known from a single tooth found at the Miocene-aged Two Tree Site fossil beds in Riversleigh in Queensland, Australia. <s> The type material, a single tooth, was discovered in 2012 by a team from the University of New South Wales including Mike Archer, Suzanne Hand, and Rebecca Pian. <s> The description, published in the same year, was the fourth species of the family Ornithorhynchidae to be described, the second from the Riversleigh site, and estimated to have been the largest. <s> The specific name was chosen in honour of an indigenous Australian creation story for the platypus, where a duck named Tharalkoo gives birth to a chimeric creature after being ravished by a rakali. <s> An ornithorhynchid-like monotreme with a bill resembling the modern aquatic forager, the platypus, but a much larger animal that was probably up to one metre long. <s> The species was estimated to have been present in the middle and upper Miocene (5â€“15 million years ago). <s> The wear patterns on the tooth are suggestive of crushing, perhaps by consuming hard-shelled animals such as turtles, rather than using a shearing action. <s> "Obdurodon tharalkooschild" is believed to have been carnivorous and estimated to be twice the size of the modern platypus at one metre long.
The River Dart is a river in Devon, England which rises high on Dartmoor, and releases to the sea at Dartmouth. <s> The river's name is presumed to be Brythonic Celtic meaning 'river where oak trees grow' due to the banks of the lower Dart being covered in ancient woods of native oak. <s> The Cornish word for oak is "derow"; alternatively the word for water is "dowr", the probable source of other British hydronyms such as Derwent Water. <s> Bray notes in 1832 that the name was occasionally spelled 'Darant'. <s> The river begins as two separate branches (the East Dart and West Dart), which join at Dartmeet. <s> The paths along these rivers offer very attractive walking, and there are several small waterfalls. <s> The rivers are crossed by a number of clapper bridges, notably at the hamlet of Postbridge. <s> After leaving the moor, the Dart flows southwards past Buckfast Abbey and through the towns of Buckfastleigh, Dartington and Totnes. <s> At Totnes, where there is a seventeenth-century weir (rebuilt in the 1960s), it becomes tidal, and there are no bridges below the town. <s> The Dart estuary is a large ria and is popular for sailing. <s> The village of Kingswear and town of Dartmouth are on the east and west sides of the estuary, and are linked by two vehicle ferries and a passenger ferry. <s> The Kingswear Regatta is held each year. <s> The deep water port of Dartmouth is a sheltered haven. <s> The entrance to the river from the sea is a rocky entrance with cliffs either side. <s> On the East side Kingswear Castle sits very close to the water's edge, and on the west side Dartmouth Castle is built on a rocky promontory at sea level. <s> The castles once operated a defensive chain across the estuary, which was raised at dusk to destroy enemy ships attempting to attack the harbour. <s> The remains of the operating mechanisms for the chain are still visible in Dartmouth castle. <s> The flooded ria that forms the lower reaches of the Dart, with its deep water and steeply sloping valley sides, is a considerable barrier to crossing traffic. <s> There are no bridges below Totnes. <s> The lower section of the River Dart forms Dartmouth Harbour, a deep water natural harbour with a long history of maritime usage. <s> In modern times, the port's commercial activity has declined, but it is still a busy port for local fishing vessels and a wide variety of yachts and other private boats. <s> Several local companies specialise in shipbuilding and repairs to small tonnage craft.

The Kow Swamp archaeological site comprises a series of late Pleistocene burials within the lunette of the eastern rim of a former lake known as Kow Swamp. <s> The site is located 10 km south-east of Cohuna in the central Murray River valley, in northern Victoria, at . <s> The site is significant for archaeological excavations by Alan Thorne between 1968 and 1972 which recovered the partial skeletal remains of more than 22 individuals. <s> The name of Kow Swamp is derived from an Aboriginal word in the Yorta Yorta language, "(Ghow)", which refers to the white gypsum soil found in the area. <s> Kow Swamp is now a permanent water body, due to its use for irrigation storage, 15 kilometres in circumference, with an average depth of 3 metres. <s> Originally a low lying swamp, it was filled when the Murray River is in flood or running at high levels, while Bendigo creek provides a smaller amount of water. <s> There is evidence of recent Aboriginal occupation of the area from canoe trees and middens, while early settlers' records describe an Aboriginal ceremonial site on the north side of the swamp. <s> The most notable evidence was the discovery in 1925, on the west side of the swamp, of the Cohuna Cranium by a local earthmoving contractor. <s> The editor of the local newspaper "Cohuna Farmers Weekly" notified authorities and the significance of the discovery was realised. <s> In the 1960s, Alan Thorne also identified archaic bone from the collection at the Museum of Victoria, and traced the find spot to Kow Swamp. <s> Archaeological excavations were undertaken between 1968 and 1972 by Thorne for the Australian National University in Canberra. <s> Further remains were found around the swamp by an interested local resident, Gordon Spark. <s> By 1972 the remains of at least forty individuals had been excavated and studied. <s> These discoveries helped establish the diversity of Aboriginal genetic history and have been interpreted as representing different waves of immigrants to Australia before European discovery. <s> Radiocarbon dates returned a wide range of ages for the burials, with 13,000 Â± 280 (ANU1236) from shell in the grave of KS5 and 10,070 Â± 250 (ANU-403b), from bone apatite from KS10 respectively. <s> The youngest date was approximately 6500 BP for KS1. <s> Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating was undertaken of the Kow Swamp burial site in 2003 (close to KS 9, the only burial excavated in situ), which suggested that the cemetery was in use between 22 and 19 ka, rather than 15 â€“ 9 ka. <s> Some question the OSL dates due to the difficulty of ensuring that the dated sand is contemporary with the actual burials. <s> However, the OSL dates from the burial units directly contradict the C14 dates, which were only ever minimum ages because of contamination by younger carbon. <s> The initial descriptions of the crania from Kow Swamp identified "receding frontal squama, massive supraorbital regions and a supraglabella fossae..." which were considered to be "preserving an almost unmodified eastern erectus form" displaying a ".. <s> complex of archaic characteristics not seen in recent Aboriginal crania...". <s> The features were considered to indicate "the survival of "Homo erectus" features in Australia until as recently as 10,000 years ago". <s> However, Donald Brothwell disputed this interpretation suggesting the vault size and shape at Kow Swamp had been influenced by artificial cranial deformation, particularly in Kow Swamp 5. <s> The varying morphological and metrical comparisons of the burials have distinguished them from modern Aboriginal crania and also a more gracile group of Pleistocene remains found at Lake Mungo and Keilor. <s> These differences have been used to postulate separate arrivals of distinct groups of people. <s> However, more recent comparison does not support Thorne's dual Pleistocene population model. <s> Following a campaign by Aboriginal community groups to have human remains repatriated from Australian and overseas museum collections, the Kow Swamp skeletons were returned to the area and re-interred. <s> Casts of some of the Kow Swamp crania and mandibles are held by the Archaeology and Human Sciences department at the Australian National University, with some casts (including casts of KS1 and 5) being sent to the London Natural History Museum and other institutions. <s> Despite extensive reconstruction, the Kow Swamp material was extremely fragmentary, with only two of the crania, KS1 and 5, being relatively complete.

A liqueur is an alcoholic drink composed of distilled spirits and additional flavorings such as sugar, fruits, herbs, and spices. <s> Often served with or after dessert, they are typically heavily sweetened and un-aged beyond a resting period during production, when necessary, for their flavors to mingle. <s> Liqueurs are historical descendants of herbal medicines. <s> They were made in Italy as early as the 13th century, often prepared by monks (for example, Chartreuse). <s> Today they are produced the world over, commonly served straight, over ice, with coffee, in cocktails, and used in cooking. <s> The French word "liqueur" is derived from the Latin "liquifacere", which means "to dissolve". <s> In some parts of the United States and Canada, liqueurs may be referred to as cordials, or schnapps. <s> This can cause confusion as in the United Kingdom a cordial would refer to a non-alcoholic concentrated fruit syrup, typically diluted to taste and consumed as a non-carbonated soft drink. <s> Schnapps, on the other hand, can refer to any distilled beverage in Germany and aquavit in Scandinavian countries. <s> In the United States and Canada, where spirits are often called "liquor" , there is often confusion discerning between liqueurs and liquors, due to the many different types of flavored spirits that are available today (e.g., flavored vodka). <s> Liqueurs generally contain a lower alcohol content (15â€“30% ABV) than spirits and it has sweetener mixed, while some can have an ABV as high as 55%.

An amicus curiae (literally, "friend of the court"; plural, amici curiae) is someone who is not a party to a case and may or may not have been solicited by a party and who assists a court by offering information, expertise, or insight that has a bearing on the issues in the case; and is typically presented in the form of a brief. <s> The decision on whether to consider an amicus brief lies within the discretion of the court. <s> The phrase "amicus curiae" is legal Latin. <s> The "amicus curiae" figure originates in Roman law. <s> Starting in the 9th century, it was incorporated into English law, and it was later extended to most common law systems. <s> Later, it was introduced in international law, in particular concerning human rights. <s> From there, it was integrated in some civil law systems (it has recently been integrated into Argentina's law system and Honduras's 2010 civil procedures code). <s> Today, it is used by the European Court of Human Rights, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, the Court of Justice of the European Union and the Special Tribunal for Lebanon. <s> The situation most often noted in the press is when an advocacy group files a brief in a case before an appellate court in which it is not a litigant. <s> Appellate cases are normally limited to the factual record and arguments coming from the lower court case under appeal; attorneys focus on the facts and arguments most favorable to their clients. <s> Where a case may have broader implications, "amicus curiae" briefs are a way to articulate those concerns, so that the possibly broad legal or public policy ramifications of the court's anticipated decisions will not depend solely on the positions and arguments advanced by the parties directly involved in the case. <s> In prominent cases, "amici curiae" are generally organizations with sizable legal budgets. <s> In the United States, for example, non-profit legal advocacy organizations, such as the American Civil Liberties Union, the Landmark Legal Foundation, the Pacific Legal Foundation, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the American Center for Law and Justice or NORML, frequently submit such briefs to advocate for or against a particular legal change or interpretation. <s> If a decision could affect an entire industry, companies other than the litigants may wish to have their concerns heard. <s> In the United States, federal courts often hear cases involving the constitutionality of state laws. <s> Hence states may file briefs as "amici curiae" when their laws or interests are likely to be affected, as in the Supreme Court case "McDonald v. Chicago," when thirty-two states under the aegis of Texas (and California independently) filed such briefs. <s> "Amici curiae" who do not file briefs often present an academic perspective on the case. <s> For example, if the law gives deference to a history of legislation of a certain topic, a historian may choose to evaluate the claim from specialized expertise. <s> An economist, statistician, or sociologist may choose to do the same. <s> Newspaper editorials, blogs, and other opinion pieces arguably have the capability to influence Supreme Court decisions as "de facto amici curiae". <s> They are not, however, technically considered "amicus curiae," as they do not submit materials to the Court, do not need to ask for leave, and have no guarantee that they will be read. <s> The Supreme Court of the United States has special rules for "amicus curiae" briefs sought to be filed in cases pending before it. <s> Supreme Court Rule 37 states, in part, such a brief should cover "relevant matter" not dealt with by the parties which "may be of considerable help". <s> The cover of an "amicus" brief must identify which party the brief is supporting, or if the brief supports only affirmance or reversal. <s> The Court also requires that, "inter alia", all non-governmental amici identify those providing a monetary contribution to the preparation or submission of the brief. <s> Briefs must be prepared in booklet format, and 40 copies must be served with the Court. <s> In the United States Supreme Court, unless the "amicus" brief is being filed by the federal government (or one of its officers or agents) or a U.S. state, permission of the court (by means of motion for leave) or mutual consent of the parties is generally required. <s> Allowing an "amicus curiae" to present oral argument is considered "extraordinary". <s> The court can also appoint its own "amicus curiae" if neither party supports the decision of the lower court, which it has done at least 44 times. <s> The role of "amicus curiae" briefs in the World Trade Organization (WTO) dispute settlement system is controversial. <s> The controversy arises due to the governmental nature of WTO disputes. <s> As only WTO members have access to the system, any non-members such as non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are excluded and have no right to be heard. <s> Thus the only way for them to contribute to a WTO decision is through "amicus curiae" briefs. <s> To date there is a divergence in approaches in the WTO as to the admissibility of such briefs.

Marie Antoine (Antonin) CareÌ‚me (] ; 8 June 178412 January 1833) was a French chef and an early practitioner and exponent of the elaborate style of cooking known as "grande cuisine", the "high art" of French cooking: a grandiose style of cookery favoured by both international royalty and by the newly rich of Paris. <s> CareÌ‚me is often considered one of the first internationally renowned celebrity chefs. <s> Abandoned by his parents in Paris in 1794 at the height of the French Revolution, he worked as a kitchen boy at a cheap Parisian chophouse in exchange for room and board. <s> In 1798, he was formally apprenticed to Sylvain Bailly, a famous "paÌ‚tissier" with a shop near the Palais-Royal. <s> The post-revolutionary Palais-Royal was a high profile, fashionable neighborhood filled with vibrant life and bustling crowds. <s> Bailly recognized his talent and ambition. <s> By the time he was prepared to leave Bailly, he could stipulate that he should be free to leave his new employer when a better offer came along. <s> CareÌ‚me opened his own shop, the "PaÌ‚tisserie de la rue de la Paix", which he maintained until 1813. <s> CareÌ‚me gained fame in Paris for his "pieÌ€ces monteÌes", elaborate constructions used as centerpieces, which Bailly had displayed in the paÌ‚tisserie window. <s> He made these confections, which were sometimes several feet high, entirely out of foodstuffs such as sugar, marzipan, and pastry. <s> He modeled them on temples, pyramids, and ancient ruins, taking ideas from architectural history books which he studied at the nearby BibliotheÌ€que Nationale, thanks to the enlightened attitude of his first employer Bailly. <s> He is credited with the inventions of "gros nougats" and "grosses meringues", "croquantes", made of almonds and honey, and "solilemmes". <s> He did freelance work creating pieces principally for the French diplomat and gourmand Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-PeÌrigord, but also other members of Parisian high society, including Napoleon. <s> While working on his confections at many private kitchens, he quickly extended his culinary skills to main courses. <s> Napoleon was famously indifferent to food, but he understood the importance of social relations in the world of diplomacy. <s> In 1804, he gave money to Talleyrand to purchase ChaÌ‚teau de ValencÌ§ay, a large estate outside Paris. <s> The chaÌ‚teau was intended to act as a kind of diplomatic gathering place. <s> When Talleyrand moved there, he took CareÌ‚me with him. <s> CareÌ‚me was set a test by Talleyrand: to create a whole yearâ€™s worth of menus, without repetition, and using only seasonal produce. <s> CareÌ‚me passed the test and completed his training in Talleyrand's kitchens. <s> After the fall of Napoleon, CareÌ‚me went to London for a time and served as "chef de cuisine" to the Prince Regent, later George IV. <s> Returning to the continent, he accepted the invitation of Tsar Alexander I to come to St. Petersburg, but stayed so briefly that he prepared not even a single meal for the Tsar. <s> Upon returning to Paris, he became chef to banker James Mayer Rothschild. <s> CareÌ‚me died in his Paris house on the Rue Neuve Saint Roche at the age of 48, due perhaps to many years inhaling the toxic fumes of the coal burning stoves over which he cooked. <s> He is remembered as the founder of the haute cuisine concept and is interred in the Montmartre Cemetery in Paris. <s> In his first major position, CareÌ‚me worked as "chef de cuisine" to Talleyrand, who actively encouraged CareÌ‚me in the development of a new refined food style using herbs, fresh vegetables, and simplified sauces with few ingredients. <s> Talleyrand became a famous host during the Congress of Viennaâ€”by the time the congress disbanded, not only the map of Europe but also the culinary tastes of its upper classes had been thoroughly revised. <s> CareÌ‚me's impact on culinary matters ranged from trivial to theoretical. <s> He is credited with creating the standard chef's hat, the "toque", he designed new sauces and dishes, and he published a classification of all sauces into groups based on four mother sauces. <s> He is also frequently credited with replacing the practice of "service aÌ€ la francÌ§aise" (serving all dishes at once) with "service aÌ€ la russe" (serving each dish in the order printed on the menu) after he returned from service in the Russian court, but others say he was a diehard supporter of "service aÌ€ la francÌ§aise".

David Hunter Hubel (February 27, 1926 â€“ September 22, 2013) was a Canadian American neurophysiologist noted for his studies of the structure and function of the visual cortex. <s> He was co-recipient with Torsten Wiesel of the 1981 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (shared with Roger W. Sperry), for their discoveries concerning information processing in the visual system. <s> For much of his career, Hubel was the John Franklin Enders University Professor of Neurobiology at Harvard Medical School. <s> In 1978, Hubel and Wiesel were awarded the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize from Columbia University. <s> The Hubel and Wiesel experiments greatly expanded the scientific knowledge of sensory processing. <s> The partnership lasted over twenty years and became known as one of the most prominent research pairings in science. <s> In one experiment, done in 1959, they inserted a microelectrode into the primary visual cortex of an anesthetized cat. <s> They then projected patterns of light and dark on a screen in front of the cat. <s> They found that some neurons fired rapidly when presented with lines at one angle, while others responded best to another angle. <s> Some of these neurons responded to light patterns and dark patterns differently. <s> Hubel and Wiesel called these neurons simple cells." <s> Still other neurons, which they termed complex cells, detected edges regardless of where they were placed in the receptive field of the neuron and could preferentially detect motion in certain directions. <s> These studies showed how the visual system constructs complex representations of visual information from simple stimulus features. <s> Hubel and Wiesel received the Nobel Prize for two major contributions: firstly, their work on development of the visual system, which involved a description of ocular dominance columns in the 1960s and 1970s; and secondly, their work establishing a foundation for visual neurophysiology, describing how signals from the eye are processed by visual parcels in the neo-cortex to generate edge detectors, motion detectors, stereoscopic depth detectors and color detectors, building blocks of the visual scene. <s> By depriving kittens from using one eye, they showed that columns in the primary visual cortex receiving inputs from the other eye took over the areas that would normally receive input from the deprived eye. <s> This has important implications for the understanding of deprivation amblyopia, a type of visual loss due to unilateral visual deprivation during the so-called critical period. <s> These kittens also did not develop areas receiving input from both eyes, a feature needed for binocular vision. <s> Hubel and Wiesel's experiments showed that the ocular dominance develops irreversibly early in childhood development. <s> These studies opened the door for the understanding and treatment of childhood cataracts and strabismus. <s> They were also important in the study of cortical plasticity. <s> Hubel married Ruth Izzard in 1953; she died February 17, 2013. <s> The couple had three sons and four grandchildren. <s> He died in Lincoln, Massachusetts from kidney failure on September 22, 2013 at the age of 87.

Roger Joseph Boscovich, S.J. (; ] ; ; ; 18 May 1711 â€“ 13 February 1787) was a physicist, astronomer, mathematician, philosopher, diplomat, poet, theologian, Jesuit priest, and a polymath from the Republic of Ragusa (modern-day Dubrovnik, Croatia). <s> He studied and lived in Italy and France where he also published many of his works. <s> Boscovich produced a precursor of atomic theory and made many contributions to astronomy, including the first geometric procedure for determining the equator of a rotating planet from three observations of a surface feature and for computing the orbit of a planet from three observations of its position. <s> In 1753 he also discovered the absence of atmosphere on the Moon. <s> Boscovich was born on 18 May 1711 in Ragusa (Dubrovnik), Republic of Ragusa, to Nikola BosÌŒkovicÌ, a Ragusan merchant, and Paola Bettera (1674â€“1777), daughter of a local nobleman of Italian origin. <s> He was baptised on 26 May 1711 by Marinus Carolis, "curatus et sacristia". <s> The name RuÄ‘er/Ruggiero may have been given to him because both his great-grandfather Agostino Bettera and his mother's brother were called Ruggiero, the godparent was his uncle Ruggiero Bettera. <s> He was the seventh child of the family and the second youngest. <s> His father was born in 1642, at Orahov Do near Ravno, at the time part of the Ottoman Empire (now Bosnia and Herzegovina). <s> His father was rich in trading experience and knowledge of that part of the Ottoman Empire, but RuÄ‘er knew him only as a bedridden invalid with paralysed legs and he died when RuÄ‘er was 10 years old. <s> Boscovich's mother Paola, nicknamed "Pavica", was a member of a cultivated Italian merchant family established in Dubrovnik since the early 17th century, when her ancestor Pietro Bettera settled from Bergamo in northern Italy. <s> She was a robust and active woman with a happy temperament who lived to 103. <s> On 16 September 1725, RuÄ‘er BosÌŒkovicÌ left Dubrovnik for Rome. <s> He was in the care of two Jesuit priests who took him to the Society of Jesus, famous for its education of youth and at that time having some 800 establishments and 200,000 pupils under its care throughout the world. <s> We learn nothing from BosÌŒkovicÌ himself until the time he entered the novitiate in 1731, but it was the usual practice for novices to spend the first two years not in the Collegium Romanum but in Sant'Andrea delle Fratte. <s> There, he studied mathematics and physics; and so brilliant was his progress in these sciences that in 1740 he was appointed professor of mathematics in the college. <s> Notwithstanding the arduous duties of his professorship, he found time for investigation in various fields of physical science, and he published a very large number of dissertations, some of them of considerable length. <s> Among the subjects were the transit of Mercury, the Aurora Borealis, the figure of the Earth, the observation of the fixed stars, the inequalities in terrestrial gravitation, the application of mathematics to the theory of the telescope, the limits of certainty in astronomical observations, the solid of greatest attraction, the cycloid, the logistic curve, the theory of comets, the tides, the law of continuity, the double refraction micrometre, and various problems of spherical trigonometry. <s> In 1742 he was consulted, with other men of science, by Pope Benedict XIV, as to the best means of securing the stability of the dome of St. Peter's, Rome, in which a crack had been discovered. <s> His suggestion of placing five concentric iron bands was adopted. <s> In 1745 BosÌŒkovicÌ published "De Viribus Vivis" in which he tried to find a middle way between Isaac Newton's gravitational theory and Gottfried Leibniz's metaphysical theory of monad-points. <s> He developed a concept of "impenetrability" as a property of hard bodies which explained their behaviour in terms of force rather than matter. <s> Stripping atoms of their matter, impenetrability is disassociated from hardness and then put in an arbitrary relationship to elasticity. <s> Impenetrability has a Cartesian sense that more than one point cannot occupy the same location at once. <s> A dispute arose between Francis the Grand Duke of Tuscany and the Republic of Lucca with respect to the drainage of a lake. <s> As agent of Lucca, BosÌŒkovicÌ was sent, in 1757, to Vienna and succeeded in bringing about a satisfactory arrangement in the matter. <s> In Vienna in 1758, he published the first edition of his famous work, "PhilosophiÃ¦ naturalis theoria redacta ad unicam legem virium in natura existentium" ("Theory of Natural philosophy derived to the single Law of forces which exist in Nature"), containing his atomic theory and his theory of forces. <s> A second edition was published in 1763 in Venice and a third again in Vienna in 1764. <s> In 1922 it was published in London, and in 1966 in the United States. <s> Another edition was published in Zagreb in 1974.

In mathematics, a divisor of an integer formula_1, also called a factor of formula_1, is an integer formula_3 that may be multiplied by some integer to produce formula_1. <s> In this case, one also says that formula_1 is a multiple of formula_6 An integer formula_1 is divisible by another integer formula_3 if formula_3 is a divisor of formula_1; this implies dividing formula_1 by formula_3 leaves no remainder. <s> Divisors can be negative as well as positive, although sometimes the term is restricted to positive divisors. <s> For example, there are six divisors of 4; they are 1, 2, 4, âˆ’1, âˆ’2, and âˆ’4, but only the positive ones (1, 2, and 4) would usually be mentioned. <s> 1 and âˆ’1 divide (are divisors of) every integer. <s> Every integer (and its negation) is a divisor of itself. <s> Integers divisible by 2 are called even, and integers not divisible by 2 are called odd. <s> 1, âˆ’1, "n" and âˆ’"n" are known as the trivial divisors of "n". <s> A divisor of "n" that is not a trivial divisor is known as a non-trivial divisor ( or strict divisor ) . <s> A non-zero integer with at least one non-trivial divisor is known as a composite number, while the units âˆ’1 and 1 and prime numbers have no non-trivial divisors. <s> There are divisibility rules that allow one to recognize certain divisors of a number from the number's digits. <s> The total number of positive divisors of formula_1 is a multiplicative function formula_63, meaning that when two numbers formula_3 and formula_1 are relatively prime, then formula_66. <s> For instance, formula_67; the eight divisors of 42 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21 and 42. <s> However, the number of positive divisors is not a totally multiplicative function: if the two numbers formula_3 and formula_1 share a common divisor, then it might not be true that formula_66.

The Veiled Christ (Italian: "Cristo velato") is a 1753 marble sculpture by Giuseppe Sanmartino exhibited in the Cappella Sansevero, Naples. <s> "Veiled Christ" is considered one of the world's most remarkable sculptures, and legendary thought to have been created by alchemy. <s> Sculptor Antonio Canova, who tried to acquire the work, declared that he would willingly give up ten years of his life to produce a similar masterpiece. <s> "Veiled Christ"' s production was originally assigned to the sculptor Antonio Corradini, who specialized in veiled statues. <s> However, Corradini died a short time later, having produced only a terracotta bozzetto (today displayed at the Museo nazionale di San Martino). <s> The job thus passed to Giuseppe Sanmartino, who was charged with producing "a marble statue sculpted with the greatest realism, representing Our Lord Jesus Christ in death, covered by a transparent shroud carved from the same block of stone as the statue." <s> Sanmartino produced a work with the dead Christ laid on a couch, covered by a veil which adheres perfectly to his form. <s> The mastery of the Neapolitan sculptor lies in his successful depiction, looking through the veil, of the suffering that Christ had undergone during the crucifixion. <s> Signs of Jesus's pain can be seen on his face and body. <s> Shaping further detail into the marble block, at Jesus's feet Sanmartino has carved depictions of the instruments of Christ's torture: the crown of thorns, pliers, and shackles. <s> In reality, a close analysis leaves no doubt that the work was entirely produced in marble. <s> This is also confirmed by some letters written at the time of its production. <s> A receipt of payment to Sanmartino, dated 16 December 1752 and signed by the prince, is preserved in the Historical archive of the Bank of Naples, states: In other letters, di Sangro also states that the veil was produced from the same block of stone as the statue.

Muhi-ud-Din Muhammad (3 November 16183 March 1707), commonly known by the sobriquet Aurangzeb (Persian: "Ornament of the Throne") or by his regnal title Alamgir (Persian: "Conqueror of the World"), was the sixth Mughal emperor, who ruled over almost the entire South Asia for a period of 49 years. <s> Widely considered to be the last effective major ruler of the Mughal Empire, Aurangzeb compiled the Fatawa-e-Alamgiri, and was among the few monarchs to have fully established Sharia law and Islamic economics throughout the Indian subcontinent. <s> He was an accomplished military leader whose rule has been the subject of praise, though he has also been described as the most controversial ruler in Indian history. <s> He was a notable expansionist; during his reign, the Mughal Empire reached its greatest extent, ruling over nearly all of the Indian subcontinent. <s> During his lifetime, victories in the south expanded the Mughal Empire to 4 million square kilometres, and he ruled over a population estimated to be over 158 million subjects, with an annual revenue of $450 million (more than ten times that of his contemporary Louis XIV of France), or Â£38,624,680 (2,879,469,894 rupees) in 1690. <s> Under his reign, India surpassed Qing China to become the world's largest economy and biggest manufacturing power, worth nearly a quarter of global GDP and more than the entirety of Western Europe, and its largest and wealthiest subdivision, the Bengal Subah, signaled the proto-industrialization. <s> By 1689, the conquest of Golconda, Mughal victories in the south expanded the Mughal Empire to 4 million square kilometres, with a population estimated to be over 158 million. <s> But this supremacy was short-lived. <s> Jos Gommans, Professor of Colonial and Global History at the University of Leiden, says that "... the highpoint of imperial centralisation under emperor Aurangzeb coincided with the start of the imperial downfall." <s> Many Indian historians consider his death year 1707 as the one which marks the end of Medieval Indian history and the start of Modern Indian history when classifying Indian history. <s> This is because of the start of decline of the Mughal empire and the start of domination of European powers in India.

Tropical Storm Beryl was the third tropical storm of the 2006 Atlantic hurricane season. <s> Developing from a tropical disturbance on July 18, it tracked generally northward, and strengthened to attain peak winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) under generally favorable conditions. <s> After turning to the northeast, Beryl weakened over cooler waters. <s> On July 21 it struck the island of Nantucket, and shortly thereafter it became extratropical. <s> The extratropical remnants continued northeastward through Nova Scotia, and on July 22 it merged with an approaching cold front. <s> Beryl produced rough seas along the northeast United States coastline. <s> In Massachusetts, its impact was limited to light rainfall and gusty winds, with no reported damage. <s> Beryl later produced moderate rainfall and gusty winds across Atlantic Canada, resulting in some localized power outages though little damage. <s> No deaths were reported. <s> A cold front moved off the East Coast of the United States on July 16 and stalled off the coast of North Carolina. <s> It gradually decayed into a surface low pressure trough, and developed into two disturbances; one was centered 290 miles (490 km) south-southeast of Cape Cod and another was located 200 miles (320 km) south of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. <s> The first low quickly organized into an unnamed tropical storm, and the other area initially remained broad and ill-defined. <s> However, by July 18, the system became much better organized with improved banding features, and the area developed into Tropical Depression Two while located 220 miles (355 km) south-southeast of Cape Hatteras. <s> The depression moved slowly to the north-northwest through a break in the subtropical ridge, and as convective banding features became more prominent the system intensified into Tropical Storm Beryl. <s> Throughout much of its duration, the storm tracked through an environment with light vertical wind shear and well-established upper-level outflow. <s> Shortly after becoming a tropical storm, the low-level circulation of Beryl became exposed with limited deep convection, though deep convection re-developed the following morning. <s> Outflow continued to improve, and with warm sea surface temperatures Beryl gradually intensified to attain peak winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) early on July 20 while located about 120 miles (190 km) east of Nags Head, North Carolina. <s> Beryl maintained peak winds for about 18 hours as it paralleled the Mid-Atlantic and New Jersey coasts, during which an eye-like feature developed in the center of the convection. <s> Late on July 20, it began a slow weakening trend after passing over cooler waters. <s> Steering winds ahead of an approaching mid-level trough caused Beryl to accelerate northeastward, and early on July 21 the center of the storm crossed the island of Nantucket. <s> The convection diminished as it moved through progressively colder waters, and shortly after 1200 UTC on July 21 Beryl became an extratropical cyclone a short distance east of Cape Cod. <s> Hours later, it made landfall in southwestern Nova Scotia, and on July 22 the extratropical remnants of Beryl merged with an approaching cold front over Newfoundland. <s> Forecasters initially predicted Beryl to brush the Carolinas; as such, a tropical storm watch was issued for the eastern coast of North Carolina from Cape Lookout northward to Currituck Beach Lighthouse. <s> When a more northeastward track became apparent, a tropical storm watch was issued about 33 hours prior to moving ashore from Woods Hole to Plymouth, Massachusetts, including Cape Cod, Nantucket, and Martha's Vineyard. <s> About 22 hours before landfall, the National Hurricane Center replaced the watch with a tropical storm warning for the same area, and also issued a tropical storm watch from Woods Hole, Massachusetts westward to New Haven, Connecticut and for the eastern portion of Long Island from east of Fire Island to Port Jefferson. <s> In anticipation for the storm, the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency was activated as a trial run for the hurricane season. <s> Local Red Cross chapters were opened, as well, with two volunteer teams placed on standby to assist. <s> Across southeastern Massachusetts, police departments maintained extra staff in preparation for any potential problems from the storm. <s> Many fishermen secured their boats, while some business owners boarded up windows to prevent storm damage. <s> Several days prior to the passage of Beryl through Atlantic Canada, the Canadian Hurricane Centre issued gale warnings for the coastal waters off Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. <s> In anticipation of heavy rainfall, the agency also issued heavy rainfall warnings for western Nova Scotia, including Halifax. <s> The storm caused high waves along the East Coast of the United States, with 19-foot seas (5.97 m) in the open ocean. <s> Waves along the southern coast of Nantucket reached 10 feet (3 m) in height as the storm approached the island, resulting in four people being rescued by lifeguards from rip currents. <s> High surf also occurred along the southern coast of Massachusetts, prompting the closing of the ferry between Nantucket and Boston. <s> Beryl produced a storm surge of 0.9 feet (.27 m) on Nantucket. <s> Winds across southeastern Massachusetts were fairly light, with no sustained tropical storm force winds and wind gusts peaking at 44 mph (71 km/h); unofficially gusts reached 51 mph (82 km/h). <s> Beryl dropped moderate precipitation just offshore, though the maximum precipitation total in the United States was only 0.97 inches (24.6 mm) on Nantucket. <s> Rainfall along southeastern Massachusetts reached 0.33 inches (8.38 mm) at Chatham. <s> The only reported damage were some downed telephone poles and fallen tree branches. <s> Overall impact was minor; there were no reported power outages, deaths, injuries, or maritime emergencies in association with the storm. <s> The remnants of Beryl dropped moderate precipitation in Atlantic Canada, officially peaking at 2.8 inches (71 mm) in Scots Bay, Nova Scotia with an unofficially higher total of 3.5 inches (88 mm); in some locations 1 inch of rain fell in an hour. <s> Additionally, a station in Fredericton, New Brunswick reported 1.77 inches (45 mm) in two hours. <s> The rainfall caused some flooding, with some overflown streams flooding some streets. <s> Moderate winds were reported along its path, which peaked at 60 mph (96 km/h) in southern Nova Scotia. <s> The winds downed some tree limbs and led to some power outages. <s> Overall damage was minor.

Knowledge can refer to a theoretical or practical understanding of a subject. <s> It can be implicit (as with practical skill or expertise) or explicit (as with the theoretical understanding of a subject); it can be more or less formal or systematic. <s> In philosophy, the study of knowledge is called epistemology; the philosopher Plato famously defined knowledge as "justified true belief", though this definition is now thought by some analytic philosophers to be problematic because of the Gettier problems, while others defend the platonic definition. <s> However, several definitions of knowledge and theories to explain it exist. <s> The definition of knowledge is a matter of ongoing debate among philosophers in the field of epistemology. <s> The classical definition, described but not ultimately endorsed by Plato, specifies that a statement must meet three criteria in order to be considered knowledge: it must be justified, true, and believed. <s> Some claim that these conditions are not sufficient, as Gettier case examples allegedly demonstrate. <s> There are a number of alternatives proposed, including Robert Nozick's arguments for a requirement that knowledge 'tracks the truth' and Simon Blackburn's additional requirement that we do not want to say that those who meet any of these conditions 'through a defect, flaw, or failure' have knowledge. <s> Richard Kirkham suggests that our definition of knowledge requires that the evidence for the belief necessitates its truth. <s> In many expressions of Christianity, such as Catholicism and Anglicanism, knowledge is one of the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit. <s> In Islam, knowledge (Arabic: Ø¹Ù„Ù…, "Ê¿ilm") is given great significance. <s> "The Knowing" ("al-Ê¿AliÌ„m") is one of the 99 names reflecting distinct attributes of God. <s> The Qur'an asserts that knowledge comes from God and various "hadith" encourage the acquisition of knowledge. <s> Muhammad is reported to have said "Seek knowledge from the cradle to the grave" and "Verily the men of knowledge are the inheritors of the prophets". <s> Islamic scholars, theologians and jurists are often given the title "alim", meaning "knowledgeble".
Gesso (] ; "chalk", from the , from ) is a white paint mixture consisting of a binder mixed with chalk, gypsum, pigment, or any combination of these. <s> It is used in artwork as a preparation for any number of substrates such as wood panels, canvas and sculpture as a base for paint and other materials that are applied over it. <s> Gesso is used by sculptors to prepare the shape of the final sculpture (fused bronze) or directly as a material for sculpting. <s> Gesso can also be used as a layer between sculpted wood and gold leaf. <s> In this case, a layer of refined and coloured clay, called â€˜boleâ€™ is used to cover the gesso before applying the gold. <s> This is usually red in colour. <s> Modern "acrylic gesso" is a widely used ground that is a combination of calcium carbonate with an acrylic polymer, medium latex, a pigment and other chemicals that ensure flexibility, and increase archival life. <s> It is technically not "gesso" at all. <s> "The Painter's Handbook" notes a problem with using oil paints over an acrylic gesso ground instead of a traditional oil ground, citing a mismatch in flexibility over time that could cause the oil paint to delaminate.

Tarsiers are any haplorrhine primates of the family Tarsiidae, which is itself the lone extant family within the infraorder Tarsiiformes. <s> Although the group was once more widespread, all of its species living today are found in the islands of Southeast Asia. <s> Fossils of tarsiiform primates are found in Asia, Europe, and North America, with disputed fossils from Africa, but extant tarsiers are restricted to several Southeast Asian islands in Indonesia, Philippines, and Malaysia, The fossil record indicates that their dentition has not changed much, except in size, in the past 45 million years. <s> The genus "Tarsius" has a longer fossil record than any other primate genus, but the assignment of the Eocene and Miocene fossils to the genus is questionable. <s> Tarsiers are small animals with enormous eyes; each eyeball is approximately 16 mm in diameter and is as large as, or in some cases larger than, its entire brain. <s> The unique cranial anatomy of the tarsier results from the need to balance their large eyes and heavy head so they are able to wait silently for nutritious prey. <s> Tarsiers have a strong auditory sense, and their auditory cortex is distinct. <s> Tarsiers also have long hind limbs, owing mostly to the elongated tarsus bones of the feet, from which the animals get their name. <s> The combination of their elongated tarsi and fused tibiofibulae makes them morphologically specialized for vertical clinging and leaping. <s> The head and body range from 10 to 15 cm in length, but the hind limbs are about twice this long (including the feet), and they also have a slender tail from 20 to 25 cm long. <s> Their fingers are also elongated, with the third finger being about the same length as the upper arm. <s> Most of the digits have nails, but the second and third toes of the hind feet bear claws instead, which are used for grooming. <s> Tarsiers have soft, velvety fur, which is generally buff, beige, or ochre in color. <s> Unlike many nocturnal vertebrates, tarsiers lack a light-reflecting layer (tapetum lucidum) of the retina and have a fovea. <s> The tarsier's brain is different from that of other primates in terms of the arrangement of the connections between the two eyes and the lateral geniculate nucleus, which is the main region of the thalamus that receives visual information. <s> The sequence of cellular layers receiving information from the ipsilateral (same side of the head) and contralateral (opposite side of the head) eyes in the lateral geniculate nucleus distinguishes tarsiers from lemurs, lorises, and monkeys, which are all similar in this respect. <s> Some neuroscientists suggested that "this apparent difference distinguishes tarsiers from all other primates, reinforcing the view that they arose in an early, independent line of primate evolution." <s> Tarsiers are the only extant entirely carnivorous primates: they are primarily insectivorous, and catch insects by jumping at them. <s> They are also known to prey on birds, snakes, lizards, and bats. <s> Gestation takes about six months, and tarsiers give birth to single offspring. <s> Young tarsiers are born furred, and with open eyes, and are able to climb within a day of birth. <s> They reach sexual maturity by the end of their second year. <s> Sociality and mating system varies, with tarsiers from Sulawesi living in small family groups, while Philippine and western tarsiers are reported to sleep and forage alone. <s> Tarsiers tend to be extremely shy animals.

Nathaniel Lyon (July 14, 1818 â€“ August 10, 1861) was the first Union general to be killed in the American Civil War and is noted for his actions in the state of Missouri at the beginning of the conflict. <s> He fought in the Second Seminole War and the Mexicanâ€“American War, before being sent to the divided state of Kansas, where he developed strong pro-Union views. <s> In February 1861, Lyon was made commander of the Union arsenal in St. Louis, Missouri (another divided state), where Lyon forced the surrender of the pro-Confederate militia. <s> This caused a riot by civilians, with Lyonâ€™s troops firing into the crowd (Camp Jackson Affair). <s> Lyon was promoted brigadier-general and given command of Union troops in Missouri. <s> He was killed at the Battle of Wilsonâ€™s Creek, while trying to rally his outnumbered soldiers. <s> However, Lyonâ€™s efforts had prevented the State of Missouri from joining the Confederacy. <s> Lyon was born on a farm which was then in Ashford, Connecticut, now in the town of Eastford, the son of Amasa and Kezia Knowlton Lyon and brother of William H.

Anne Marie d'OrleÌans (27 August 1669 â€“ 26 August 1728) was the first Queen consort of Sardinia by marriage to Victor Amadeus II of Savoy. <s> She served as regent of Savoy during the absence of her spouse in 1686 and during the War of the Spanish Succession. <s> She is also an important figure in British history (see Jacobite Succession below). <s> She was the daughter of Philippe I, Duke of OrleÌans, younger brother of Louis XIV, and Henrietta of England, the youngest daughter of Charles I of England. <s> Her mother died at the "ChaÌ‚teau de Saint-Cloud" ten months after Anne Marie's birth. <s> A year later, her father married 19-year-old Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate, who became very close to her stepdaughters. <s> Her half-brother Philippe II, Duke of OrleÌans, the future regent of France, was born of her father's second marriage. <s> Her stepmother later described her as "one of the most amiable and virtuous of women". <s> The proxy marriage of Anne Marie and ViÌctor Amadeus took place at Versailles on 10 April 1684, the day after the signature of the marriage contract. <s> Her husband-to-be was represented by her cousin, Louis Auguste, Duke of Maine. <s> Louis XIV gave her a dowry of 900,000 "livres". <s> The Duke of OrleÌans accompanied his daughter as far as Juvisy-sur-Orge (18 kilometers south of Paris), and the comtesse de Lillebonne accompanied her all the way to Savoy. <s> She met her husband Victor at ChambeÌry on 6 May, the nuptials being performed at the castle by the Archbishop of Grenoble. <s> Two days later, the newlyweds made their "Joyous Entry" into Turin. <s> This marriage was arranged with the assistance of the mareÌchal de TesseÌ and of Jeanne Baptiste d'Albert de Luynes, comtesse de VerrueÌ, who was Victor's mistress from 1689 till 1700. <s> Her husband had two children with Jeanne. <s> Nonetheless, when he fell ill with smallpox, Anne Marie nursed him until his recovery. <s> Despite his marriage ties to France, Victor Amadeus joined the anti-French side in the War of the Spanish Succession. <s> Anne Marie was appointed by him to serve as regent of Savoy during his absence in the war, a task she handled with maturity and judgement. <s> In 1706, Turin was besieged by French forces under the command of Anne Marie's half-brother Philippe d'OrleÌans, and Spanish forces of her cousin and son-in-law Philip V. <s> She and her sons Victor Amadeus and Carlo Emanuele were forced to flee to Genoa. <s> When the war was ended in 1713 by the Treaty of Utrecht, Victor Amadeus received the Kingdom of Sicily, formerly a Spanish possession. <s> Anne Marie's stepmother wrote: "I shall neither gain nor lose by the peace, but one thing I shall enjoy is to see our Duchess of Savoy become a queen, because I love her as though she were my own child ..." When Victor Amadeus left for his coronation in Sicily, he had originally planned to leave Anne Marie behind to function as regent in his absence, but as he feared that she would let herself be directed by his mother because of her loyalty to her, he changed his mind and took her along with him instead. <s> Anne Marie was crowned with him in Sicily. <s> At the death of her eldest son in 1715, both she and Victor Amadeus fell into severe depression and left the capital to mourn, leaving Marie Jeanne to handle their official duties. <s> Victor Amadeus was forced to exchange Sicily for the less important domain of Sardinia in 1720, but retained the title of King. <s> As the Savoyard consort, Anne-Marie had the use of the Royal Palace of Turin, the vast Palazzina di caccia di Stupinigi outside the capital, and the Vigna di Madama Reale. <s> Queen Anne Marie died of heart failure at her villa on 26 August 1728, the day before her 59th birthday. <s> She is buried at the Basilica of Superga in Turin, where all her children, except Marie-AdeÌlaiÌˆde and Maria Luisa, are also buried. <s> From 1714 to 1720, Anne Marie d'OrleÌans was the heiress presumptive to the Jacobite claim to the thrones of England, Scotland, and Ireland. <s> These claims were held at the time by James Francis Edward Stuart ("the Old Pretender", son of James II). <s> Anne Marie became heiress presumptive with the death of James' daughter Queen Anne in 1714. <s> She was displaced as heir by the birth of the Old Pretender's son, Charles Edward Stuart ("Bonnie Prince Charlie"), on 31 December 1720. <s> Charles Edward and his brother Henry, Cardinal Stuart, both died without legitimate issue, so the descendants of Anne Marie d'OrleÌans inherited the Jacobite claim, i.e. they would have inherited the British crown had it not been for the Act of Settlement, which excluded the claims of the Catholic Stuarts and d'OrleÌans' and settled the throne on the nearest Protestant relatives, the Hanoverians.
