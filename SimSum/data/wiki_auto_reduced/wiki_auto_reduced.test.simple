The Turin King List, also called the Turin Royal Canon, is a list of the kings of Egypt. <s> The list is now in the Egyptian Museum in Turin. <s> The papyrus is the most complete list of kings written by the Egyptians. <s> It is the basis working out the dates of kings before the rule of Ramesses II. <s> It is thought to date from the rule of Pharaoh Ramesses II. <s> The papyrus is believed to have been written in the time of Ramesses II, during the middle of the New Kingdom, or the 19th Dynasty. <s> The beginning and ending of the list are lost. <s> There is no introduction, and the list stops after the 19th Dynasty. <s> It may have been written at any later time, from Ramesses II to as late as the 20th Dynasty. <s> The papyrus lists the names of rulers, the lengths of their rule in years, with months and days for some kings. <s> In some cases they are grouped together by family. <s> This grouping is almost the same as the dynasties of Manethoâ€™s book. <s> The list includes the names of kings who only ruled for a very short time, or those ruling small areas that may not be in listed in other sources. <s> The list also is believed to contain kings from the 15th Dynasty, the Hyksos who ruled Lower Egypt and the River Nile delta. <s> The Hyksos rulers do not have cartouches (borders around the name of a king). <s> They do have a hieroglyphic sign to show that they were foreigners. <s> The papyrus was a tax roll, but on its back is written a list of rulers of Egypt. <s> It includes the mythical kings such as gods, demi-gods, and spirits, as well as human kings. <s> As the papyrus was reused for the tax roll, it shows the list was not of great formal importance to the writer. <s> The list is thought to have been used as an administrative aid. <s> As such, the papyrus is not supposed to be biased against certain rulers and is believed to include all the kings of Egypt up through at least the 19th Dynasty. <s> The papyrus was found by the Italian traveler Bernardino Drovetti in 1820 at Luxor (Thebes). <s> In 1824 was put in the Egyptian Museum in Turin, Italy, and known as Papyrus Number 1874. <s> When the box in which it had been taken to Italy was unpacked, the list had broken up into small pieces. <s> Jean-Francois Champollion could read only some of the larger pieces which had royal names. <s> The Saxon researcher Gustav Seyffarth (1796â€“1885) looked carefully at some of the pieces, some only one square centimeter in size. <s> He made a more complete reconstruction of the papyrus based only on the papyrus fibers, as he could not read the hieratic characters. <s> Later work by the Munich Egyptologist Jens Peter Lauth, largely agreed with Seyffarth's work. <s> In 1997 Egyptologist Kim Ryholt published a new version of the list in his book, "The Political Situation in Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period c.1800-1550 B.C." Egyptologist Donald Redford has also studied the papyrus and has noted that many of the listâ€™s names match historic monuments and other documents. <s> The list may not be completely accurate for pre-Ramesses II chronology. <s> About 50% of the papyrus is missing. <s> It is 1.7 m long and 0.41 m wide, broken into over 160 pieces. <s> In 2009 new pieces were discovered in the storage room of the Egyptian Museum of Turin, in good condition. <s> A new edition of the papyrus is expected. <s> The name Hudjefa, is listed twice in the papyrus. <s> The name is now known to have been used by the royal scribes of Ramesses II when the name of a king was unreadable or missing. <s> The papyrus is divided into eleven columns. <s> The names and positions of several kings are still uncertain as the list is so badly damaged.

Castration is any action, surgical, chemical, or otherwise, by which a male loses the functions of the testes or a female loses the functions of the ovaries. <s> Castration was frequently used in certain cultures of Europe, the Middle East, India, Africa and China, for political, religious or social reasons. <s> After battles in some cases, victors castrated their captives or the corpses of the defeated to symbolise their victory and 'seize' their power. <s> Castrated men â€” eunuchs â€” were often admitted to special social classes and were used particularly to staff bureaucracies and palace households: in particular, the harem. <s> Castration also figured in a number of religious castration cults. <s> Other religions, for example Judaism and Islam, were strongly opposed to the practice. <s> The "Leviticus Holiness code", for example, specifically excludes eunuchs or any males with defective genitals from the priesthood, just as castrated animals are excluded from sacrifice. <s> Eunuchs in China have been known to usurp power in many eras of Chinese history, most notably in the Later Han, late Tang and late Ming Dynasties. <s> There are similar recorded Middle Eastern events. <s> Unless both testicles are cancerous, only one is removed. <s> Edward Gibbon's famous work "Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire" reports castration of defeated foes at the hands of the Normans. <s> In China, to become a servant of the emperor, men had to be castrated. <s> In Europe, when females were not permitted to sing in church or cathedral choirs in the Roman Catholic Church, boys were sometimes castrated to prevent their voices breaking at puberty and to develop a special high voice. <s> The first documents mentioning castrati are Italian church records from the 1550s. <s> Castration is commonly performed on domestic animals not intended for breeding. <s> Domestic animals are usually castrated in order to avoid unwanted or uncontrolled reproduction; to reduce or prevent other ways of sexual behaviour such as territorial behaviour or aggression (like fighting between groups of uncastrated males of a species); or to reduce other consequences of sexual behaviour that may make animal husbandry more difficult, such as fence destruction when animals try to get to nearby females of the species. <s> Male horses are usually castrated, because stallions are rather aggressive. <s> The same applies to male mules, although they are sterile. <s> Male cattle are castrated to improve docility for use as oxen.

Halophiles are organisms that need salt in their environment to live. <s> The name "halophile" comes from Greek for "salt-loving". <s> Most halophiles are archaeans, but some bacteria and eukaryotes are also halophiles, such as the alga "Dunaliella salina". <s> Halophiles live in evaporation ponds or salt lakes such as Great Salt Lake, Owens Lake, or Dead Sea. <s> Halophiles are categorized by the levels of salt at which they grow best. <s> Halophiles can either be categorized as slight halophiles, moderate halophiles, or extreme halophiles. <s> Slight halophiles grow best in concentrations of salt around 2% to 5%. <s> Moderate halophiles grow best in concentrations of salt around 5% to 20%. <s> Extreme halophiles grow best in concentrations of salt from 20% to 30%. <s> Most halophilic and salt-eating animals use energy to remove salt from their cytoplasm. <s> To get to this state, halophiles use two different methods. <s> In the first (mainly used by bacteria, some archaea, yeasts, algae and fungi), organic compounds are stored in the cytoplasm. <s> The most commonly used solutes for this process are neutral and include amino acids and sugars. <s> The second, less common adaptation, is the selective intake of potassium (K) ions into the cytoplasm. <s> The main disadvantage to this adaption is that all of the machinery inside the cell (enzymes, structural proteins, etc.) must be adapted to high levels of non-organic ions, and high salt levels.

The Ramsey theory is named after the British mathematician and philosopher Frank Ramsey (1903â€“1930). <s> It is a branch of mathematics that studies the conditions under which order must appear. <s> Ramsey theory is now a complete branch of mathematics. <s> A typical result in Ramsey theory starts with some mathematical structure that is then cut into pieces. <s> How big must the original structure be, so that at least one of the pieces has a given interesting property? <s> This idea can be defined as partition regularity. <s> For example, consider a complete graph of order "n"; that is, there are "n" vertices and each vertex is connected to every other vertex by an edge. <s> A complete graph of order 3 is called a triangle. <s> Now colour every edge red or blue. <s> How large must "n" be in order to ensure that there is either a blue triangle or a red triangle? <s> It turns out that the answer is 6. <s> Another way to express this result is as follows: at any party with at least six people, there are three people who are either (a) mutual acquaintances (each one knows the other two) or (b) mutual strangers (each one does not know either of the other two).

The Sumerians had a myth of the goddess Inanna descending into the Underworld. <s> At each of the seven gates, she removed an article of clothing or a piece of jewelry. <s> As long as she remained in hell, the earth was barren. <s> When she returned, fecundity abounded. <s> Salome's dance for King Herod is referred to in the New Testament (Matthew 14:6 and Mark 6:21-22). <s> However, the first mention of her removing seven veils is in Oscar Wilde's play of "Salome" in 1893. <s> In ancient Greece, the lawgiver Solon established several classes of prostitutes in the late 6th century BC. <s> Among these were the "auletrides": female dancers, acrobats, and musicians, noted for dancing naked in an alluring fashion in front of audiences of men. <s> In ancient Rome, dance featuring stripping was part of the Floralia, an April festival. <s> Empress Theodora, wife of 6th-century Byzantine emperor Justinian is reported by several ancient sources to have started in life as a courtesan and actress who performed in acts inspired from mythological themes and in which she disrobed "as far as the laws of the day allowed". <s> She was famous for her striptease performance of "Leda and the Swan". <s> From these accounts, it appears that the practice was not exceptional or new. <s> It was, however, actively opposed by the Christian Church, which got statutes banning it in the following century. <s> The degree to which these statutes were enforced is open to question. <s> No practice of the sort is reported in texts of the European Middle Ages. <s> Some have claimed as the origin of modern striptease. <s> After Wilde's play and Richard Strauss's opera "Salome", first performed in 1905 the erotic 'dance of the seven veils', became a standard routine in opera, vaudeville, film and burlesque. <s> A famous early practitioner was Maud Allan who in 1907 gave a private performance of the dance to Edward VII. <s> In the 1880s and 1890s, Parisian shows such as the Moulin Rouge and Folies BergeÌ€re had attractive scantily-clad women dancing and "tableaux vivants" (static poses). <s> Acts in the 1890s had a woman slowly removed clothes in a vain search for a flea crawling on her body. <s> The "People's Almanac" credits this as the origin of modern striptease. <s> Starting in 1905, Mata Hari entered the scene. <s> Another landmark performance was the appearance at the Moulin Rouge in 1907 of an actress called Germaine Aymos who entered dressed only in three very small shells. <s> In the 1930s the famous Josephine Baker danced semi-nude in the "danse sauvage" at the Folies and other such performances were provided at the Tabarin. <s> These shows were notable for their sophisticated choreography and often dressing the girls in glitzy sequins and feathers. <s> By the 1960s "fully nude" shows were provided at such places as Le Crazy Horse Saloon. <s> There is also a film called "Striptease".

Emmeline Pankhurst (neÌe Goulden; 15 July 1858 â€“ 14 June 1928) was the leader of the British suffragette movement which helped women win the right to vote. <s> In 1999 "Time" named Pankhurst as one of the 100 Most Important People of the 20th Century, stating: "she shaped an idea of women for our time; she shook society into a new pattern from which there could be no going back." <s> She was widely criticized for her militant tactics, but her work helped to achieve women's suffrage in Britain. <s> After her husband died in 1898, Pankhurst founded the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), an organisation dedicated to "deeds, not words". <s> The group became infamous when its members smashed windows and assaulted police officers. <s> Pankhurst, her daughters, and other WSPU activists were sentenced to repeated prison sentences, where they staged hunger strikes to secure better conditions. <s> As Pankhurst's oldest daughter Christabel took the helm of the WSPU, antagonism between the group and the government grew. <s> Eventually arson became a common tactic among WSPU members, and more moderate organisations spoke out against the Pankhurst family. <s> In 1913 several prominent individuals left the WSPU, among them Pankhurst's daughters Adela and Sylvia. <s> The family rift never healed. <s> With the advent of the First World War, Emmeline and Christabel called an immediate halt to militant suffrage activism in support of the British Government's stand against the "German Peril". <s> They urged women to aid industrial production and encouraged young men to fight. <s> In 1918 the Representation of the People Act granted votes to women over the age of 30 and the WSPU was disbanded. <s> Pankhurst transformed the WSPU machinery into the Women's Party, dedicated to promoting women's equality in public life. <s> In her later years she became concerned with the 'Bolshevik menace' and â€“ unhappy with the political alternatives â€“ joined the Conservative Party. <s> She died in 1928, 17 days before women got equal voting rights and was commemorated two years later with a statue in London's Victoria Tower Gardens.

Bit-level parallelism is a form of parallel computing based on increasing processor word size, depending on very-large-scale integration (VLSI) technology. <s> Enhancements in computers designs were done by increasing bit-level parallelism <s> Increasing the word size reduces the number of instructions the processor must execute in order to perform an operation on variables whose sizes are greater than the length of the word. <s> (For example, consider a case where an 8-bit processor must add two 16-bit integers. <s> The processor must first add the 8 lower-order bits from each integer, then add the 8 higher-order bits, requiring two instructions to complete a single operation. <s> A 16-bit processor would be able to complete the operation with single instruction) <s> Historically, 4-bit microprocessors were replaced with 8-bit, then 16-bit, then 32-bit microprocessors, then 64-bit microprocessors. <s> 32-bit processors has been a standard in general purpose computing for about 20 years, but now 64-bit processors are taking the lead.

For example, every natural number has another natural number larger than it. <s> Two basic kinds of quantifiers used in predicate logic are universal and existential quantifiers. <s> Quantifiers are also used in natural languages. <s> Examples of quantifiers in English are "for all", "for some", "many", "few", "a lot", and "no". <s> This is a problem for formal languages, since a formal statement needs to be finite in length. <s> The two quantifiers most widely used are the universal quantifier and the existence quantifier. <s> The universal quantifier is symbolized with "âˆ€", an upside down "A", to stand for "all". <s> An existence quantifier (symbolized with "âˆƒ") states that at least one element considered fits the criteria. <s> The existential quantifier is symbolized with "âˆƒ", a backwards "E", to stand for "exists". <s> We can rewrite an example English statement with symbols, predicates representing criteria, and quantifiers. <s> The example is "Each of Peter's friends either likes to dance or likes to go to the beach". <s> Let "X" be the set of all Peter's friends. <s> Let "P"("x") be the predicate ""x" likes to dance". <s> Let "Q"("x") be the predicate ""x" likes to go to the beach". <s> We can rewrite the example using formal notation as formula_1. <s> The statement can be read as "for every "x" that is a member of "X", "P" applies to "x" or "Q" applies to "x"." <s> It states that every natural number has a square. <s> However, if we turn the order of the quantifiers around: This statement is false. <s> It claims that there is one natural number "s" that is the square of "every" natural number. <s> The solution quantifier is represented by a Â§ (section sign). <s> The use of quantification was closer to that of natural language. <s> This meant that statements in term logic with quantifiers were less suited for formal analysis. <s> Term logic included quantifiers for "All", "Some" and "No" (none) in 4th century BC. <s> In 1879, Gottlob Frege created a notation for universal quantification. <s> Unlike today, he would represent a universal quantification by writing a variable over a dimple in an otherwise straight line. <s> Frege did not create a notation for existential quantification. <s> Frege's use of quantification was not widely known until Bertrand Russell's 1903 "Principles of Mathematics". <s> In 1885, Charles Sanders Peirce and his student Oscar Howard Mitchell also created a notation for universal and existential quantifiers. <s> They wrote Î  and Î£ where we now write âˆ€"x" and âˆƒ"x". <s> Pierce's notation was used by many mathematicians into the 1950s. <s> In 1897, William Ernest Johnson and Giuseppe Peano created another notation for universal and existential quantification. <s> Johnson and Peano used the simple ("x") for universal quantification, and âˆƒ"x" for existential quantification. <s> In 1935, Gerhard Gentzen created the âˆ€ symbol for universal quantification. <s> It was not widely used until the 1960s.

Adriaen Coorte (about 1665 â€“ 1707) was a Dutch painter. <s> He signed works between 1683 and 1707. <s> He mainly painted 'still life'. <s> Coorte was "one of the last practitioners of this intimate category". <s> Very little is known about his life. <s> He was probably born in Middelburg and also died there. <s> He became a pupil of Melchior d'Hondecoeter around 1680 in Amsterdam. <s> From 1683 he seems to have returned to Middelburg, where he set up a workshop and signed his small, carefully balanced minimalist still lifes. <s> He often painted on paper that was glued to a wooden panel. <s> About 80 signed works by him have been catalogued, and nearly all of them follow the same pattern; small arrangements of fruits, vegetables, or shells on a stone slab, lit from above, with the dark background typical of still lifes earlier in the century. <s> Instead of the Chinese or silver vessels favoured by his contemporaries, his tableware is very basic pottery. <s> "Objects and light are studied intensely, and are painted with a wondrous tenderness". <s> Neither his birth nor death date is certain, and archival evidence only exists in Middelburg for his membership in the Guild of St. Luke there from 1695 onwards, when he was fined for selling a painting without being a member of the guild. <s> His works appear frequently in contemporary Middelburg taxation inventories <s> Coorte was probably not well known to the people who lived at the same time, outside the city of Middelburg. <s> Much like Vermeer, he was almost entirely forgotten. <s> In the 1950s, the Dutch art historian Laurens J. Bol revived his reputation, beginning with an article in 1952, and finally publishing the first monograph and catalogue raissone on Coorte in 1977 ("Adriaen Coorte", Amsterdam). <s> Bol arranged an exhibition of 35 examples of Coorte's work in 1958 at the Dordrechts Museum. <s> This became a sensation in the Netherlands; the poets Hans Faverey and Ed Leeflang were both inspired by the paintings. <s> In 2003 there was an exhibition at the National Gallery of Art, Washington. <s> In 2008 a new travelling exhibition was set up; "Ode to Coorte", that was nearly as successful, making Coorte the most celebrated "rediscovered" Dutch Baroque painter of recent decades.

A syllogism is a deduction. <s> It is a kind of logical argument in which one proposition (the "conclusion") is inferred from two or more others (the premises). <s> In the "Prior Analytics", Aristotle defines the syllogism as "a discourse in which, certain things having been supposed, something different from the things supposed results of necessity because these things are so". <s> The syllogism was replaced by first-order logic after the work of Gottlob Frege, published in 1879. <s> Each of the three distinct terms represents a category. <s> In the above example, "men," "mortal," and "Greeks." <s> "Mortal" is the major term; "Greeks", the minor term. <s> The premises also have one term in common with each other, which is known as the "middle term"; in this example, "man." <s> Both of the premises are universal, as is the conclusion. <s> The major premise is universal; the minor premise and the conclusion are particular. <s> Here, the major term is "die", the minor term is "men," and the middle term is "mortals". <s> A sorites is a form of argument in which a series of incomplete syllogisms is so arranged that the predicate of each premise forms the subject of the next until the subject of the first is joined with the predicate of the last in the conclusion. <s> For example, if one argues that a given number of grains of sand does not make a heap and that an additional grain does not either, then to conclude that no additional amount of sand will make a heap is to construct a sorites argument.

In 1855, two English scientists, Joseph Dalton Hooker and Edward William Binney, found coal balls in England. <s> Because of that, the initial research on coal balls was done in Europe. <s> Coal balls were found and identified in North America in 1922. <s> Since then, coal balls have been found in other countries and several theories on their formation have been proposed. <s> Coal balls are in coal seams across North America and Eurasia. <s> North American coal balls are in more places than in Europe. <s> The oldest coal balls were found in Germany and former Czechoslovakia. <s> Marie Stopes and D.M.S. Watson also examined coal ball samples. <s> They agreed that coal balls formed "in situ". <s> They also added that interaction with a marine environment was necessary for a coal ball to form. <s> Coal balls are not made of coal, even though they have the name "coal ball". <s> Coal balls are permineralised life forms that are full of calcium, magnesium and occasionally iron sulfide. <s> In 1962, Sergius Mamay and Ellis Yochelson found signs of marine animal remains in North American coal balls. <s> The quality of the preservation of organic material depends on the speed of the burial process and the degree of compression before undergoing permineralisation. <s> Generally, coal balls resulting from remains that have a quick burial with little decay and pressure have a higher preservation degree. <s> However, plant remains in most coal balls show various signs of decay and collapse. <s> Thin sectioning was an early procedure used to analyse fossilised material contained in coal balls. <s> The ball was cut into thin sections with a diamond saw. <s> Then it was flattened and polished with an abrasive. <s> Then it was examined under a microscope. <s> The time needed, and the poor quality of samples produced, led to a more convenient method. <s> The new method, first used in 1928, is called the "liquid peel technique".

An ecosystem is a large community of living organisms (plants, animals and microbes) in a particular area. <s> The living and physical components are linked together through nutrient cycles and energy flows. <s> What drives all ecosystems is the primary production. <s> Primary production is the production of organic matter from inorganic carbon sources. <s> This happens through photosynthesis. <s> It drives the carbon cycle, which influences global climate via the greenhouse effect. <s> Through the process of photosynthesis, plants capture energy from light and use it to combine carbon dioxide and water to produce carbohydrates and oxygen. <s> The photosynthesis carried out by all the plants in an ecosystem is called the gross primary production (GPP). <s> About 48â€“60% of the GPP is consumed in plant respiration. <s> The rest is known as the net primary production (NPP). <s> Total photosynthesis is limited by a range of environmental factors. <s> These include the amount of light available, the amount of leaf area a plant has to capture light (shading by other plants limits photosynthesis), the supply of carbon dioxide and water, and suitable temperatures for carrying out photosynthesis. <s> Ecosystems are stable, but not rigid.

IC 10 is an irregular galaxy in the constellation Cassiopeia. <s> It was discovered in 1887. <s> Edwin Hubble suspected it might belong to the Local Group of galaxies, but this was uncertain for decades. <s> The radial velocity of IC 10 was measured in 1962. <s> It is approaching the Milky Way at about 350 km/s. <s> This strengthened the evidence for its being in the Local Group. <s> Its membership in the group was finally confirmed in 1996 by measurements of its distance by observations of Cepheids. <s> Despite its closeness, the galaxy is rather difficult to study because it lies near the galactic plane of the Milky Way. <s> It is heavily obscured by interstellar matter. <s> The apparent distance between IC 10 and the Andromeda Galaxy is about the same as the apparent distance between the Andromeda Galaxy and the Triangulum Galaxy, which suggests that IC 10 may belong to the M31 subgroup. <s> IC 10 is the only known starburst galaxy in the Local Group of galaxies. <s> It has many more Wolf-Rayet stars per square kiloparsec (5.1 stars/kpc2) than the Large Magellanic Cloud (2.0 stars/kpc2) or the Small Magellanic Cloud (0.9 stars/kpc2). <s> Although the galaxy has a luminosity similar to the SMC, it is much smaller. <s> The evolutionary status of the Wolf-Rayet stars suggests they all formed in a relatively short period. <s> The galaxy produces stars at the rate of 0.04â€“0.08 solar masses per year, which means that the gas supply in the galaxy can last for a few billion years longer. <s> Observations of IC 10 in the far-infrared show that the dust in this mild starburst galaxy is deficient in small grains. <s> Perhaps small grains were destroyed by strong ultraviolet radiation in the areas around the hot luminous stars. <s> The galaxy has a huge envelope of hydrogen gas, with an apparent size measuring 68â€² Ã— 80â€², which is far larger than the apparent size of the galaxy in visible light (5.5â€² Ã— 7.0â€²). <s> IC 10 is also unusual in the respect that the visible part of the galaxy seems to rotate in a different direction than the outer envelope. <s> It has an H II nucleus.
John Forrest Dillon (December 25, 1831 â€“ May 6, 1914) was an American judge. <s> He wrote an important book on the power of states about municipal governments. <s> Dillon was born in Northampton, Montgomery County, New York. <s> Shortly after beginning to work as a doctor, he switched to studying law, and was admitted to the Iowa bar in 1852. <s> He was elected as the Scott County prosecutor after a brief private practice in 1853, and was then elected to a judgeship in Iowa's 7th Judicial Circuit in 1858. <s> He joined to the Iowa Supreme Court in 1862 and served until 1869, when he was appointed by President Grant to the United States Circuit Court. <s> While Dillon was a federal judge, he wrote "Municipal Corporations" (1872), which was one of the earliest books to present the subject, and people still study it today. <s> He was also the author of "Removal of Cases from State Courts to Federal Courts" and "Municipal Bonds", both in 1876. <s> On February 17, 1876, Justice Dillon ruled Ulysses S. Grant's deposition for Orville E. Babcock was admissible in court during the Whiskey Ring graft prosecutions. <s> After leaving the Circuit Court, Dillon was a professor at Columbia Law School from 1879 until 1882, where he taught real estate and equity. <s> He then taught at Yale Law School from 1891 until 1892. <s> Dillon then returned to private practice until his death in 1914 in New York City. <s> A memorial fountain to Dillon was built in downtown Davenport, Iowa in 1918. <s> Sculptor Harry Liva carved it out of Indiana limestone in Romanesque style. <s> Dillon's oldest son, Hiram Price Dillon (1855 â€“ 1918), also became a lawyer in Iowa, and a Master of Chancery in federal court. <s> The theory of state preeminence over local governments was called the "Dillon Rule" in an 1868 case: "Municipal corporations owe their origin to, and derive their powers and rights wholly from, the legislature. <s> It breathes into them the breath of life, without which they cannot exist. <s> As it creates, so may it destroy. <s> If it may destroy, it may abridge and control." <s> As opposed to the Dillon Rule, the Cooley Doctrine expressed the theory of an inherent right to local self-determination. <s> In a concurring opinion, Michigan Supreme Court Judge Thomas M. Cooley in 1871 stated: â€œLocal government is a matter of absolute right; and the state cannot take it away.â€ <s> In "Municipal Corporations" (1872), Dillon explained that in contrast to the powers of states, which are unlimited but for express restrictions under the state or federal constitution, municipalities only have the powers that the state legislature expressly gives to them. <s> This formulation of the scope of municipal power came to be known as the "Dillon Rule". <s> It says that municipal governments only have the powers that are expressly granted to them by the state legislature, those that are necessarily implied from that grant of power, and those that are essential and indispensable to the municipality's existence and functioning. <s> If the legislative grant of power is unclear, it should be read narrowly. <s> However, when the state has not specifically directed the method by which the municipality may implement its granted power, the municipality has the discretion to choose the method so long as its choice is reasonable. <s> The Supreme Court of the United States cited Dillon's book "Municipal Corporations" and fully adopted Dillon's emphasis on state power over municipalities in "Merrill v. Monticello," 138 U.S. 673 (1891), reaff'd. <s> "Hunter v. Pittsburgh", 207 U.S. 161 (1907), which upheld the power of Pennsylvania to consolidate the city of Allegheny into the city of Pittsburgh, despite the wishes of the majority of Allegheny residents to be a separate city. <s> The Court's ruling that states could alter or abolish at will the charters of municipal corporations without infringing upon contract rights relied upon Dillon's separation of public, municipal corporations from private ones. <s> Hundreds of U.S. court decisions to the present day have employed the Dillon Rule to determine the scope of municipal powers and rights. <s> Critics of the rule say that it imposes unreasonable constraints on the ability of communities to govern themselves and so undermines democracy, and even that local self-government is a matter of natural right that does not need to be conferred by higher political structures. <s> It has also been suggested that Dillon's approach came from the view at that time that cities were inherently corrupt political organs. <s> Today, most states in the United States follow the Dillon Rule.

In statistics a confidence interval is a special form of estimating a certain parameter. <s> The likelihood that the parameter will be in the interval is called confidence level. <s> The confidence interval is based on the observations from a sample, and hence differs from sample to sample. <s> People may speak about the "95% confidence interval". <s> In common usage, a claim to 95% confidence in something is normally taken as indicating virtual certainty. <s> For a given estimation procedure in a given situation, the higher the confidence level, the wider the confidence interval will be. <s> A machine fills cups with margarine. <s> For the example, the machine is adjusted so that the content of the cups is 250g of margarine. <s> As the machine cannot fill every cup with exactly 250g, the content added to individual cups shows some variation, and is considered a random variable X. <s> This variation is assumed to be normally distributed around the desired average of 250g, with a standard deviation of 2.5g. To determine if the machine is adequately calibrated, a sample of "n" = 25 cups of margarine is chosen at random and the cups are weighed. <s> The weights of margarine are "X", ..., "X", a random sample from "X". <s> To get an impression of the expectation Î¼, it is sufficient to give an estimate. <s> If we take another sample of 25 cups, we could easily expect to find values like 250.4 or 251.1 grams. <s> A sample mean value of 280 grams however would be extremely rare if the mean content of the cups is in fact close to 250g. <s> There is a whole interval around the observed value 250.2 of the sample mean within which, if the whole population mean actually takes a value in this range, the observed data would not be considered particularly unusual. <s> Such an interval is called a confidence interval for the parameter "Î¼". <s> How do we calculate such an interval? <s> The endpoints of the interval have to be calculated from the sample, so they are statistics, functions of the sample "X", ..., "X" and hence random variables themselves. <s> dependent on the parameter Î¼ to be estimated, but with a standard normal distribution independent of the parameter "Î¼". <s> Hence it is possible to find numbers âˆ’"z" and "z", independent of "Î¼", where "Z" lies in between with probability 1 âˆ’ Î±, a measure of how confident we want to be. <s> We take 1 - Î± = 0.95. <s> This might be interpreted as: with probability 0.95 we will find a confidence interval in which we will meet the parameter "Î¼" between the stochastic endpoints <s> This does not mean that there is 0.95 probability of meeting the parameter Î¼ in the calculated interval. <s> Every time the measurements are repeated, there will be another value for the mean of the sample. <s> In 95% of the cases "Î¼" will be between the endpoints calculated from this mean, but in 5% of the cases it will not be. <s> The actual confidence interval is calculated by entering the measured weights in the formula. <s> As the desired value 250 of "Î¼" is within the resulted confidence interval, there is no reason to believe the machine is wrongly calibrated. <s> The calculated interval has fixed endpoints, where Î¼ might be in between (or not). <s> Thus this event has probability either 0 or 1. <s> We cannot say: "with probability (1 âˆ’ Î±) the parameter "Î¼" lies in the confidence interval." <s> We only know that by repetition in 100(1 âˆ’ Î±) % of the cases Î¼ will be in the calculated interval. <s> In 100Î± % of the cases however it does not. <s> And unfortunately we do not know in which of the cases this happens. <s> That's why we say: "with confidence level 100(1 âˆ’ Î±) %, "Î¼" lies in the confidence interval." <s> The figure on the right shows 50 realisations of a confidence interval for a given population mean Î¼. <s> If we randomly choose one realisation, the probability is 95% we end up having chosen an interval that contains the parameter; however we may be unlucky and have picked the wrong one. <s> We'll never know; we are stuck with our interval.

An undulator is an insertion device from high-energy physics and usually part of a larger installation, a synchrotron storage ring. <s> It consists of a periodic structure of dipole magnets. <s> A static magnetic field is alternating along the length of the undulator with a wavelength formula_1. <s> Electrons traversing the periodic magnet structure are forced to undergo oscillations. <s> The radiation produced in an undulator is very intense and concentrated in narrow energy bands in the spectrum. <s> The light beam is also collimated on the orbit plane of the electrons. <s> This radiation is guided through beamlines for experiments in various scientific areas. <s> where "e" is the particle charge, "B" is the magnetic field, "formula_3", "formula_4" is the electron rest mass and "c" is the speed of light, characterizes the nature of the electron motion. <s> For formula_5 the oscillation amplitude of the motion is small and the radiation displays interference patterns which lead to narrow energy bands. <s> If formula_6 the oscillation amplitude is bigger and the radiation contributions from each field period sum up independently, leading to a broad energy spectrum. <s> When K is much bigger than 1, the device is no longer called an "undulator"; it is called a wiggler. <s> This means that though the precision calculation is tedious the undulator can be seen as a black box. <s> An electron enters this box and an electromagnetic pulse exits through a small exit slit. <s> The slit should be small enough so that only the main cone passes, so that the side lobes may be ignored. <s> Undulators can provide hundreds of time more magnetic flux than a simple bending magnet and as such are in high demand at synchrotron radiation facilities. <s> For an undulator that repeat N times (N periods), the brightness can be up to formula_7 more than a bending magnet. <s> The intensity is enhanced up to a factor of N at harmonic wavelengths due to the constructive interference of the fields emitted during the N radiation periods. <s> The usual pulse is a sine wave with some envelope. <s> The second factor of N comes from the reduction of the emission angle associated with these harmonics, which is reduced in proportion to 1/N. <s> When the electrons come with half the period, they interfere destructively. <s> So, the undulator stays dark. <s> The same is true if the electrons come as a bead chain. <s> The polarization of the emitted radiation can be controlled by using permanent magnets to induce different periodic electron trajectories through the undulator. <s> If the oscillations are confined to a plane the radiation will be linearly polarized. <s> If the oscillation trajectory is helical, the radiation will be circularly polarized, with the handedness determined by the helix. <s> If the electrons follow the Poisson distribution, a partial interference leads to a linear increase in intensity. <s> In the free-electron laser the intensity increases exponentially with the number of electrons. <s> Physicists measure an undulator's effectiveness in terms of spectral radiance. <s> The Russian physicist V.L. Ginzburg showed that undulators could be made in principle in a 1947 paper. <s> The first undulator was built by Hans Motz and his coworkers at Stanford in 1953. <s> One of their undulators produced the first ever coherent infrared radiation. <s> Their total frequency range was from visible light down to millimeter waves.

An arch bridge is a bridge with abutments at each end shaped as a curved arch. <s> Arch bridges work by transferring the weight of the bridge and its loads partially into a horizontal thrust held by the abutments at either side. <s> A viaduct (a long bridge) may be made from a series of arches. <s> However other less expensive structures are typically used today. <s> The oldest existing arch bridge may be the Mycenaean Arkadiko bridge in Greece. <s> It was built in about 1300 BC. <s> The stone corbel arch bridge is still used. <s> The well-preserved Hellenistic Eleutherna Bridge has a triangular corbel arch. <s> The 4th century BC Rhodes Footbridge rests on an early voussoir arch. <s> Both the Etruscans and ancient Greeks knew about arches. <s> But the Romans were the first to use arches for bridge construction. <s> Roman arch bridges were usually semicircular. <s> A number were also segmental arch bridges (such as AlconeÌtar Bridge), meaning it has a curved arch that is less than a semicircle. <s> Such a ssegmental arch bridge allowed great amounts of flood water to pass under it. <s> This would prevent the bridge from being swept away during floods. <s> Also the bridge itself could be more lightweight. <s> Generally, Roman bridges had wedge-shaped primary arch stones (called voussoirs) of the same in size and shape. <s> The Romans built both single spans and lengthy multiple arch aqueducts. <s> Their bridges featured flood openings in the piers. <s> In medieval Europe, bridge builders improved on the Roman structures by using narrower piers. <s> They used thinner arch barrels and lower span-rise ratios on bridges. <s> Gothic pointed arches were also introduced reducing lateral thrust. <s> In particular the 14th century saw bridge construction reaching new heights. <s> Spans of up to 40 m were previously unheard of in masonry arch construction. <s> Stone, brick and other similar materials are strong in compression. <s> They are fairly strong in shear. <s> But they cannot resist much force in tension. <s> As a result, masonry arch bridges are designed to be constantly under compression. <s> Each arch is constructed over a temporary falsework frame, known as a centring. <s> In the first compression arch bridges, a keystone in the middle of the bridge bore the weight of the rest of the bridge. <s> The more weight that was put onto the bridge, the stronger its structure became. <s> Masonry arch bridges use fill material (typically compacted rubble) above the arch in order to increase this dead-weight on the bridge. <s> This also prevents tension from occurring in the arch ring as loads move across the bridge. <s> Unreinforced concrete was also used. <s> When masonry (cut stone) is used, the angles of the faces are cut to minimize shear forces. <s> Where random masonry (uncut and unprepared stones) is used they are mortared together. <s> The mortar is allowed to set before the falsework is removed.

Territorialism, also known as Statism (but not to be confused with another belief also called statism), was a Jewish political movement related to Zionism. <s> The ITO broke up in 1925. <s> The Jewish Colonization Association, started in 1891 by the Baron Maurice de Hirsch, was started to help move many Jews from Russia and other Eastern European countries. <s> Before 1905, some Zionist leaders were thinking about making places for Jews to call home other than Palestine. <s> Theodor Herzl's "Der Judenstaat" argued for a Jewish state in either Palestine, "our ever-memorable historic home", or Argentina, "one of the most fertile countries in the world". <s> Many of the socialist Zionist groups were more territorialist than Zionist, such as Nachman Syrkin's Zionist Socialist Workers Party (the Z.S.). <s> In 1903, British cabinet ministers suggested the British Uganda Programme, land for a Jewish state in "Uganda" (the land they were thinking about is actually in the modern country of Kenya). <s> At first, Herzl said no to the idea, because he liked Palestine better. <s> After the April 1903 Kishinev pogrom, in which many Jews were violently attacked in Russia, Herzl suggested to the Sixth Zionist Congress to look at the offer as a temporary way to keep Russian Jews safe. <s> The plan was very controversial, and many Russian Jews were so upset that they walked out of the meeting. <s> Few historians believe that such a settlement idea could have attracted immigrants, received much money in donations, or been supported by many other countries. <s> Because some members of the Zionist leadership liked the idea, however, peace was kept in the movement because they voted to start a committee to look at the possibility. <s> Because of this, the Jewish Territorialist Organization (ITO) led by Israel Zangwill split off from the Zionist movement. <s> It tried to find land where Jews could settle in different parts of America (e.g. Galveston), Africa, Asia, and Australia, but with little success. <s> They did not officially say no to the idea until the Seventh Zionist Congress in 1905. <s> Apart from the (ITO), within the USSR there was also a Territorialist effort in Ukraine, the Crimea and then in a region around Birobidzhan, where a Jewish Autonomous Region was started in 1934. <s> As the Holocaust became close and as Nazis were discriminating against Jews in Germany, Isaac Nachman Steinberg started the Freeland League in the United States in 1935. <s> This organization tried, but did not succeed, to start a new Jewish country by getting a large piece of land in places in Ecuador, Australia, or Suriname where not many people lived. <s> One of the more well-known tries was the Kimberley Plan, to get land in Australia. <s> After the State of Israel was created in 1948, Steinberg had criticized the exclusivist politics of the Zionist government and continued his attempts to create a non-nationalist Jewish settlement in some other part of the world. <s> After Steinberg died in 1957, the Freeland League was led by Mordkhe Schaechter, who gradually changed the focus of the organization to more cultural, Yiddishist goals.

Ancient woodland is the name used in the United Kingdom for woodland which has existed continuously since 1600 or before in England and Wales (or 1750 in Scotland). <s> Before those dates, planting of new woodland was uncommon, so a wood present in 1600 was likely to have developed naturally. <s> For many species of animal and plant, ancient woodland sites provide the only habitat. <s> For many others, conditions on these sites are much more suitable than those on other sites. <s> Ancient woodland in the UK, like rainforest in the tropics, is home to rare and threatened species, more than any other UK habitat. <s> For these reasons ancient woodland is often described as an irreplaceable resource, or 'critical natural capital'. <s> The American name for these forests is "old growth forest". <s> Ancient woodland is formally defined on maps by Natural England and equivalent bodies. <s> Many ancient woodlands have legal protection, but an ancient woodland is not automatically protected.

The Peak District is an upland area in England at the southern end of the Pennines. <s> It is mostly in northern Derbyshire but also includes parts of Cheshire, Greater Manchester, Staffordshire and Yorkshire. <s> The northern 'Dark Peak' is where most of the moorland is found. <s> The Peak District National Park became the first national park in the United Kingdom in 1951. <s> It attracts many visitors every year. <s> Much of the area is uplands above 1000 ft, with a high point on Kinder Scout of 2087 ft. Despite its name, the landscape generally lacks sharp peaks, but has rounded hills and gritstone escarpments (the "edges"). <s> The area is surrounded by major conurbations, including Huddersfield, Manchester, Sheffield, Derby and Stoke-on-Trent. <s> The Peak District is formed almost exclusively from sedimentary rocks dating from the Carboniferous period. <s> They comprise the Carboniferous limestone, the overlying gritstone and finally the coal measures at the margins of the area. <s> There are outcrops of igneous rocks including lavas, tuffs and volcanic vent agglomerates. <s> Earth movements after the Carboniferous period resulted in the up-doming of the area. <s> This resulted in the dome-like shape. <s> The shale and sandstone were worn away until limestone was exposed. <s> At the end of this period, the Earth's crust sank here which led to the area being covered by sea, depositing a variety of new rocks. <s> Some time after its deposition, mineral veins were formed in the limestone. <s> These veins and rakes have been mined for lead since Roman times. <s> The Peak District was covered by ice during at least one of the ice ages of the last 2 million years. <s> Glacial meltwaters eroded a complex of sinuous channels along the margin of the Peak District during this period. <s> Glacial meltwaters helped form many of the caves in the limestone area. <s> Wild animal herds roamed the area, and their remains have been found in several of the local caves. <s> The different types of rock that lie beneath the soil strongly influence the landscape. <s> They determine the vegetation and so the animals that will live in the area. <s> Limestone has fissures (cracks) and is soluble in water, so rivers carve deep, narrow valleys. <s> These rivers then often find a route underground, creating cave systems. <s> Millstone Grit on the other hand is insoluble but porous, so it absorbs water. <s> Water moves through the grits until it meets the less porous shales beneath, creating springs when it reaches the surface again. <s> The shales are friable and easily attacked by frost. <s> They form areas where landslides may occur, as on Mam Tor.

It happens right after diastole, when the heart refills with blood. <s> They contract (squeeze) during the last part of diastole, and send blood down to the larger, lower ventricles. <s> When the ventricles are filled and the valves to the atria are closed, the ventricles contract. <s> So, the atria and ventricles contract in sequence. <s> Then, the left and right ventricles contract. <s> (The ventricles are the largest parts of the heart, which pump blood to the body and lungs.) <s> The left and right atria feed blood into the ventricles. <s> When blood pressure is measured for medical purposes, systolic pressure is the first number in the "ratio" of systolic to diastolic pressure. <s> For example, if a person's blood pressure is 120/80, 120 is the systolic pressure, and 80 is the diastolic pressure.
